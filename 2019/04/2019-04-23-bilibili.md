Hello Dear Github:

We Are Bilibili Security Group. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and effcient platform, and now we have a need and  hopefully we are able to get Github's support and resolution. I sent the mail yesterday and the mail attachment is my signature!!

We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.

Someone created a Repository called 'openbilibili/go-common' two hours ago and many people forked it or cloned it and reuploaded the source codes to new/different repositories, the repository contained too much sensitive information, such as secret key, database address, very important api key and so on. If these information are found by other people in Github, our company will be left out of pocket.

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about this Repository:

Since the reupload repositories contain our company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration, so we hope Giuhub as soon as possible to help us completely remove the reupload repositories. Thank you very much!
   
The following is our contact information:
    
-   Company Name : Bilibili  
-   My e-mail Address: [private]  
-   Cellphone: [private]    
-   Company Address: [private]   
-   Website: https://www.bilibili.com/

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


Looking forward to your response and thanks again for your support.
Please help us!!!
