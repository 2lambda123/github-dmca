Dear Sir/Madam,

One of your users (rohanyshah) has submitted copyrighted source-code that I wrote. He has removed my name and inserted his own.

I was asked to forward this copyright infringement claim to you. I have no interest in communicating directly with the individual who has infringed upon my copyright and is now passing off my work as if it is his own. I have tracked the individual and it appears he has used the work in high-school related competitions and he is generally claiming it is his work.

The stolen source-code is available here:

https://github.com/rohanyshah/Monte-Carlo-Model

My original source-code is located here:

[private]

The accompanying paper is available here:

[private]

If you compare the following files you will see that the individual has
removed my name and replaced it with his own:

license.txt
readme.txt
Monte Carlo Simulation in Financial Valuation.r

Specifically, if you remove the copyright-header of the file "Monte Carlo
Simulation in Financial Valuation.r" you will see that the actual
source-code is identical to mine, it is only the header that has been
changed.

While the work is published under a license that allows anyone to use and
modify the source-code, the license does NOT allow people to claim
authorship of the work. That is still considered theft and a crime under
copyright laws.

...

If you do not remove the material that violates my copyright then you too
are in violation of the law for hosting it.

You ask me to include the following text in this e-mail:

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law."

"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed."

Please confirm that you will attend to this.

Sincerely, [private]
