Dear GitHub Inc and the Greater Community: 
 
We are sorry for being complete asshats and wasting everybody's time by claiming that a software project that is webbrowser was some how infringing on our copyright materials. Obviously this was a due to our total lack of understanding of the underlying technology. After doing some research we have realised that the software project does not contain any copyrighted material that might fall under the MMPA's power or jurisdiction. At least no more than a web browser does i.e. none what so ever.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me by telephone at [private], or via email at 
antipiracy@copyright.org. 
 
Regards, 

[private]
