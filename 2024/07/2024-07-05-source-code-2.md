Dear Github:
I’m [private]. It is great to be able to use Github such a professional and effcient platform, and now I have an urgent need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution. I sent the mail the day before yesterday, which attached the official paper from the owner.  
As you know, I have read and understood GitHub's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice. And here is my situation:  
Eight years ago, I created a Repository called '[private]' for my personal use. Recently, someone forked 'pombredanne/AutoCheckMHSystem' ,which contained too much sensitive and important information, such as username, password, database address and so on from my respository in Github. If those materials are searched and used for certain unknown purpose by someone in Github, I will be prosecuted legal responsibility, which I have received the official paper.  
The fork originated from the Guangdong Power Grid text system source code has infringed the copyright of the enterprise, because it is the unauthorized release, which must not be appeared in public.

The original repository I created originally was '[private]', however, I have already deleted it since I receive the warning officially below. Then it cannot be accessed now. And also I have changed the username from [private] to [private] for your reference.

Involved Company Name : Guangdong Power Grid Co., Ltd  
Involved Website: https://www.gd.csg.cn/

Chinese version of official paper:
