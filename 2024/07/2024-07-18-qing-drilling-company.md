Dear GitHub administrators,We are the developers of the QHSE Safety Inspection System for the Safety and Environmental Protection Supervision Institute of Sichuan Qing Drilling Company（http://ccde.cnpc.com.cn/）, based in [private]. This system is designed to manage on-site violations and hazards discovered at Sichuan Qing Drilling Company. It was developed by [private] from the [private] of Southwest Petroleum University. Unfortunately, some of the students were not aware of Qing Company's information system management policies and uploaded the code to GitHub without authorization. Subsequently, this repository was forked by the user bellmit.

We have already contacted former students such as [private] to delete their qhse_QualityManage_Web repositories. However, we are unable to remove the repository forked by bellmit at https://github.com/bellmit/qhse_QualityManage_Web. We kindly request your assistance in deleting this repository.

The presence of keywords related to Qing Drilling and the Safety Inspection Institute in this code was flagged during a keyword security check conducted by our security agency. This violates Qing Drilling Company's Information System Security Regulations, necessitating its deletion. Files containing these keywords are listed below:
