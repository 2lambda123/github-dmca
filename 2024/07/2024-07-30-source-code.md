Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I have my [private].

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The original repository, which contains all my coursework, exams, quizzes, code projects, and other materials for my [private], includes several technological protection measures intended to prevent unauthorized access and copying. These measures include:

1. Access Restrictions: The original repository is [private], ensuring that only authorized users with explicit permissions can view or clone the repository.  
2. Copyright Notices: Each file within the repository contains clear copyright notices, indicating that all rights are reserved and that unauthorized copying or distribution is prohibited.  
3. License Restrictions: The repository is governed by a specific license that restricts redistribution and modification without my explicit permission.

The accused project has circumvented these technological protection measures in the following ways:  
1. Unauthorized Access and Forking: Despite the [private], the infringing repository contains identical copies of the protected materials. This indicates that the individual either gained unauthorized access to the repository or used another method to obtain the files without permission.  
2. Removal of Copyright Notices: The infringing repository may have removed or altered the copyright notices included in each file, thus misrepresenting the ownership and rights associated with the content.  
3. Violation of License Terms: By redistributing and potentially modifying the content of the original repository, the accused project violates the terms of the license under which the original work is protected.

The circumvention of these measures not only breaches the legal and technical safeguards I have put in place but also exposes my [private] to potential misuse and [private] dishonesty, undermining the integrity of my [private].
