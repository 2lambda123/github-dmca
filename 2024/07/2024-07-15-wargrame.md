**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

As an [private] of Digital Extremes Ltd., I am an authorized representative of Digital Extremes Ltd., exclusive owner of the copyright protected material being infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyright work that is being infringed upon is the code of video game Warframe® which is owned by Digital Extremes Ltd. Additional information about Warframe can be found at https://www.warframe.com/, and about Digital Extremes Ltd. can be found at https://www.digitalextremes.com/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The infringing content made by user ‘Reversive’ can be found here:  
https://github.com/Reversive/warframe-luau-dump  
The infringing user can be found here:  
https://github.com/Reversive  

That link includes disassembled copies of source-code for Warframe which the user could only access by circumventing encryption and other security measures put in place by Digital Extremes. Please note, that link does not include the circumvention tools so this is not a request involving the takedown of circumvention tools, it is a request for the takedown of actual infringing copies of our copyright protected content.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Our investigation shows no other infringing content of our copyright under their profile.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
