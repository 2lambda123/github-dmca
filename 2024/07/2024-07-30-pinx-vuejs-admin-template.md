Hello,  
We have discovered that several GitHub repository owners have made our premium version template public. Pinx - Vuejs / Nuxt Tailwind + Naive Admin Dashboard Template is a premium product that we sell exclusively on ThemeForest: https://themeforest.net/item/pinx-vuejs-admin-template/47799543  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
[private], [private], are the creator of this copyrighted content. You can find the product on ThemeForest at this link: https://themeforest.net/item/pinx-vuejs-admin-template/47799543  
  
The Pinx template includes 4 projects: 2 Nuxt and 2 Vue.  
The template’s license does not allow usage in open-source projects.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
In the following repositories, one of the Nuxt projects was used and only few pages have been added:  
  
1. https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main  
2. https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis  
3. https://github.com/sunhengngouv/view-thisis  
  
In each of the 3 projects listed above, the entirety of the Pinx files was uploaded, and they can be found in these folders:  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/app-layouts  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/components  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/composables  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/cypress  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/directives

https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/middleware  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/pages (except for the Apps folder)  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/pages/Components

https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/scripts  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/stores  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/types  
https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main/tree/main/utils (except for the apiService.ts file)  
  
Plus all those directly under the directory https://github.com/sophannavouth01/view-thisis-main  
  
Even the readme is the same.  
  
Approximately 400 files.  
  
The same applies to the repositories:  
4. https://github.com/Ruttanachote/vue-ts-tailwind-naiveui  
5. https://github.com/adilxali/travel-ng  
6. https://github.com/irisetto/PIM-Dashboard-CloudLab  
7. https://github.com/plugpogpag/FormBuilderVue3  
  
which instead use the Vue project.  
  
Even worse, the repository https://github.com/Ruttanachote/vue-ts-tailwind-naiveui has uploaded the project only changing the name while keeping 100% of the files unchanged.  
  
The owners of these repositories have already been contacted by creating an issue in their projects, but I have not received any response.
