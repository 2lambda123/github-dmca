**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes, we have several technological measures in place to control access to our copyrighted content:

1. Version Control Systems: We use [private] for version control to manage and track changes to our codebase. Access to our private [private] is restricted to authorized personnel only.  
2. Access Controls: We have implemented strict access controls and permissions within our version control system. Only authorized developers and team members have access to our codebase, and access is granted based on roles and responsibilities.  
3. Authentication Measures: Access to our [private] is protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only verified users can access our code.  
4. Internal Policies: We have internal policies and agreements in place that all employees and contractors must adhere to, including confidentiality agreements and code of conduct regarding the handling of proprietary information.  
5. Audit Logs: We maintain detailed audit logs of all access and changes to our [private] to monitor and prevent unauthorized access.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is designed to circumvent our technological protection measures by bypassing our secure access controls and unauthorizedly copying our proprietary code. Specifically:

1. Unauthorized Access: Our code is stored in a private [private] on [private], not on [private]. Access to this [private] is strictly controlled through Google Identity and Access Management (IAM), which ensures that only authorized personnel can access the [private].  
2. Controlled Environment: We have implemented robust access controls and authentication measures within [private]. Access is granted only to verified employees and contractors through Google IAM, incorporating multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.  
3. Security Breach: Despite these stringent measures, the accused project has somehow obtained our proprietary code and made it publicly available on GitHub. This action indicates a deliberate attempt to bypass our secure access controls and technological protection measures designed to prevent unauthorized access and distribution.  
4. Violation of Internal Policies: All our employees and contractors are bound by confidentiality agreements and internal policies regarding the handling of our proprietary code. The unauthorized publication of our code on GitHub violates these agreements and circumvents our internal security protocols.

These actions undermine our technological protection measures, as the project on GitHub makes our proprietary code accessible to the public without authorization.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, we have conducted a search for any forks of the allegedly infringing repository on GitHub. Since our proprietary code is hosted on a private [private], this situation is unique. However, upon discovering the unauthorized posting of our code on GitHub, we took the following steps:

1. GitHub Web Interface: We navigated to the infringing repository and viewed the list of forks available through the GitHub web interface.
2. GitHub Search: We used the GitHub search functionality with the query fork:true to filter for forks of the infringing repository.

After conducting these searches, we have found that there are currently no forks of the infringing repository. We will continue to monitor GitHub for any further infringing copies and report them accordingly.
