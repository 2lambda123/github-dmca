Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I wrote all of this code my own, and the rest is public domain content. I have all version controlled code, as it was always my property. TENET was never granted ownership, only a speculative right to use it, which did not extend to ownership. This does not include content created by anyone except myself, or content that was public domain / run through an LLM of other public content. It was done on speculation by [private] for a company, TENET, that did not obtain rights, did not pay [private], and after going out of business, has no actual right to [private]s work. Furthermore, the work by [private] was never considered company property, nor under NDA, nor asked to be deleted.

[private], of TENET Enterprises, hired me to do cloud installation of code I wrote on my own time, to which he has zero copyright or ownership. This code stack does not include anything written by any other TENET employee, and the claim of an NDA are bizarre as the NDA was broken when [private] refused to pay money he owed me. If he oversold his employee's outside work or IP, he will have to deal with that on his own. This code is now public domain as it was developed as part of a government project by [private], while investigating [private] for financial fraud on behalf of the [private]. As the company TENET operated under fraudulent and criminal pretenses (coercing students to take student loans to fund [private]'s startup, doing a shell game with 401ks), this code is basically impossible for TENET to own. That is, it is public domain. The same thing with a message board used by drug dealers -- TOUGH COOKIES, GIRL SCOUT!

Additionally, plain english language "prompts" inside of the sample code came from open source public examples and then ran through an LLM; this has a negative effect on copyright/patent. IE, tenet does not "gain" ownership over other people's content. This code goes back to before TENET hired me ([private]), was done outside of work hours, and given to [private] on speculation without transfer of ownership. [private] has already threatened me with an attorney claiming my outside work (including work I did for the [private]) belongs to him. [private] has engaged in [private], steals others work and claim is his own, and is a repeat abuser of the DMCA. He has already made a bad faith attack on his former employer, [private], for a similar issue. [private] / TENET has filed a DMCA claim stating that this code base does something entirely different from what it actually does. Why? Because he didn't write it.

He does not understand that by hiring an employee to install code that person did on their own (before and independently of working for the company), he does not own that employee's work any more than he owns the car the employer drove to work in.

I told [private]/Tenet from the beginning that this is open source and my code did not become his property. [private] / TENET has filed a fraudulent DMCA case on behalf of a closed business, for work that was not the company's property. Additionally, the statement "a unique framework that allows the flexible and scalable stacking of system messages of large language models, to be used in the context of building AI applications" is bizarre and untrue, as the design documents were all my origin, and the notion of "stacking text snippets" is not something anyone can rationally claim to have invented.

As none of this was TENET's IP, please reject [private] on this and all future DMCA claims as he has a track record of abusing authority to control his unprofessional image.

Additionally please note that the business known as Tenet Enterprises ([private]) closed operations when [private]:
