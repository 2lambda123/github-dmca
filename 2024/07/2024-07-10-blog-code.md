I am the [private] and [private] of the content found at the GitHub repository located at https://github.com/windshadow233/windshadow233.github.io. This repository contains [private] personal blog’s source code, which is fully developed and maintained by [private]. The content and code in [private] repository are protected under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://github.com/windshadow233/windshadow233.github.io/blob/050c7342c0d76a035408be16fc289d42470b4941/themes/butterfly/_config.yml#L160), which I have explicitly chosen to govern the posts and other contents of [private] blog.

The repository at https://github.com/Powator/powator.github.io contains content that is directly copied and compiled from [private] original source code, with minimal changes made. This act of copying and redistribution without substantial alteration falls under the scope of derivative works. However, it has come to [private] attention that there is no proper attribution or a direct link back to [private] original work, which constitutes a violation of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license that requires appropriate credit to be given for [private] work.

Therefore, I am submitting this complaint to request the removal of the infringing content from GitHub, as it has been redistributed in violation of the applicable copyright and license terms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question is [private] personal blog, which [private] have developed and maintained. The original content includes a variety of technical tutorials, personal essays, and code snippets, all of which [private] have authored. Particularly, the blog articles, which cover topics ranging from software development to personal reflections, are crafted with original insights and are extensively detailed, representing a substantial portion of the creative effort in the site.

The entire source code of [private] blog, along with its detailed documentation, custom-designed elements, and blog posts, is hosted under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. This license covers unique scripts, layout designs, interactive features, and the text of the blog posts themselves.

The original work can be accessed at the following URL: [https://github.com/windshadow233/windshadow233.github.io](https://github.com/windshadow233/windshadow233.github.io). This repository not only hosts the source code but also includes commit history that evidences [private] continuous development and updates to the blog, including the creation and revision of blog posts.

I believe that this work has been infringed upon as the repository at https://github.com/Powator/powator.github.io contains significant portions of [private] blog articles copied verbatim or with minimal modification. This copying extends to technical content and personal essays that are unique to [private] blog. The use of this material has been done without proper attribution and without providing a link back to [private] original work, which violates the requirements of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Powator/powator.github.io

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Upon investigation, I have not found any forks of the allegedly infringing repository https://github.com/Powator/powator.github.io. It appears that the repository exists as a standalone project without any derivative forks on GitHub at this time. This should simplify the process of addressing the infringement claim as there are no additional repositories to consider beyond the original one identified. If any forks do arise in the future, I will monitor and address them accordingly.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No，actually，his GitHub profile：https://github.com/Powator/powator is also a copy of [private] : [private]（with fewer modification）, and [private] contact infomation such as email、[private] are listed in his GitHub profile rather than his infomation. So I have no contact information about him.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
