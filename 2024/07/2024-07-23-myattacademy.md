Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

BACKGROUND: In 2022, the Academy purchased a customized platform from our former [private], who was under exclusive full-time contract to the Academy. Since January 2022, we have refined, expanded, and customized the platform, which is now reflected in our website. The former [private] necessarily had full access to develop the platform. We were reliant on him to employ security measures. He was terminated in June 2024 when it was discovered that he had been using Academy resources for personal purposes and, unknown to us, had deployed our content to a third-party server for which he had sole access.  
PRESENT SECURITY MEASURES: Due to the fraudulent activities of our former [private], we established new accounts for content storage, migrated our domain and email servers, and activated MFA across all platforms. We retained a new company to manage our development needs going forward,

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Our former [private] was contractually bound to lead the Academy's [private] and signed an employment contract, code of ethics, and confidentiality agreement obliging him to honor the Academy's codes and secrets. The accused project has violated the terms he agreed to and, therefore, exposes the Academy to malicious intent.
