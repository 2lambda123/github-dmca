Velvet Client 1.18.12 ([private]) is a PRIVATE [private] modification which aims to enhance combat abilities of the user in-game. It specifically tries to give a big boost to players in an Minecraft Anarchy Server environment, where anything and everything is allowed, including similar combat-performance enhancing game modifications like Velvet. At the peak of its activity, Velvet was well known for its CrystalPlace module, which was significantly more accurate than the other similar CrystalAura modules of competing game modifications at the time.

Velvet was meant for experimental purposes, and was NEVER intended to be released. It is descended from another project, Horion Client, HOWEVER, Velvet contains significant original modifications and enhancements made by [private] team and [private], including but not limited to: CrystalPlacer/Breaker, AutoCity/CityESP, Server Disablers, Packet Miner. These modifications are protected under [private] copyright, and the unauthorized repository contains and distributes them without permission.

The accused repository in question (https://github.com/stich4life08/help), however, is an unauthorized copy of [private] modified work, entirely unaltered by its owner.

By releasing the source code, people can simply build the project without the authentication system in place.
