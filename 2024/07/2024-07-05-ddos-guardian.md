**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of DDoS Guardian. We found a company who stole and rebranded our code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."  
Our two github repo's for DDoS Guardian:  
https://github.com/DDOS-Guardian/DDoS-Guardian/
https://github.com/DDOS-Guardian/DDoS-Guardian-Layer-7/

A company named "LylaNodes" created something called "SecureShield". They stole our code and rebranded without any credit. The layer 7 they stole had the slightest amount of credit but I don't think they meant to put that it in there.

The [private] of LylaNodes said:

[private]

I have screenshot proof of that, and full proof that I and the owner of DDoS-Guardian are the owners of this code.

We have our old repo that goes way before his. Linked below

Here is one of him just changing it:
