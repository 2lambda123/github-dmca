I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

[private] repository with the following URL: https://github.com/NevermindNilas/TheAnimeScripter ,  has been subject to a DMCA takedown notice by an individual/entity claiming that my tool infringes upon their copyrighted code from a tool named "Uwu2x."

I want to emphasize the following points:

Under no circumstances is my tool, The Anime Scripter (TAS), related to, derivative of, or inspired by the tool named "Uwu2x." There is no affiliation or connection between the two tools in any form.

The DMCA strike fails to provide any proof or valid points suggesting that TAS has taken anything from Uwu2x. There is no evidence of code infringement or any other form of intellectual property violation.

The Anime Scripter (TAS) does not circumvent or employ functions from the original code of Uwu2x. My tool is independently developed and does not utilize any elements from Uwu2x.

Based on these facts, this DMCA strike appears to be falsely claimed and is therefore illegal under applicable legal jurisdictions.

Despite the request made by the opposing party, I will not be deleting my repository nor am I willing to solicit other users to delete their forks of said repository. Deleting my repository under no clear violation of any law will result in me taking legal action against both the original party that has filed the DMCA strike and GitHub.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
