Dear Github team,  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

As the WebPros [private], I represent WebPros International GmbH (formerly Plesk International GmbH) ,[private] as the owner of all intellectual property (incl. IP in the source code, trademarks and copyrights) belonging to Plesk software products.  
The obvious way such user offers cracked / pirated license information on Github makes a direct approach of the user by WebPros obsolete.  
WebPros hereby kindly requests a take-down of the Plesk crack under the aforementioned link and, if possible, a block of the originator due to the fact that he openly offers IP-infringing materials on your platform.  
The WebPros [private] is at your disposition for further questions and is ready to provide what is required to immediately stop this infringement of its rights in its products.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing account and forks is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringed product is Plesk software, available for licensing under www.plesk.com.  
The present takedown notice is directed against a crack of our proprietary software, allowing users to use it without first obtaining a (royalty-bearing) license from WebPros.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
