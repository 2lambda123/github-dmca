The information provided in this notice is accurate. I declare, under penalty of perjury, that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Despite our initial DMCA takedown notice, dated 08.02.2024 the website albkanale.github.io/ continues to engage in illegal activities by reselling our channels without proper authorization.

ART MOTION owns the exclusive rights to broadcast and distribute various channels, such as KTV, RTK, Klan Kosova, and others, in [private] and abroad. We have invested significant resources and efforts to secure these rights and to provide high-quality and affordable services to our customers.

It has come to our attention that  albkanale.github.io/ is still illegally streaming and selling our channels to its users, without our consent or license. This persistent infringement is a clear violation of our intellectual property rights and poses a serious threat to our business and reputation.

Despite our attempts to contact the website owner and request them to cease their unlawful activities, we have received no response or cooperation.

We demand that immediate and effective action be taken to remove or disable access to the website  albkanale.github.io/ and any other associated websites or platforms.

We reserve the right to pursue legal action against the website owner and any parties involved in this infringement, if necessary.
