**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and ([private]) the [private] of the repository that the offending content infringes upon.

- My Github profile is: [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A repository [private] created that includes importable action-schemas for use with ChatGPT as well as instructions for the usage thereof.

- The link to the (original) copyrighted work is: https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions  
- The link to the associated pin on [private]'s forum is: [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

- The offending repository is: https://github.com/Anil-matcha/Free-GPT-Actions

Their account may contain other instances of copyright infringement, I have not had time to check as of yet.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have identified all forks of [private] repository and have judged none (aside from the aforementioned offending content) to be in violation of it's license, as all other forks (again, aside from the offending content) have been made with the intention of contributing to my own repository, which is permissible under its license.

The offending repository itself has seemingly not been forked by anyone as of yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

[private] work is licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0 license, as can be seen here: https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/blob/main/LICENSE

- The required attribution notice is, additionally, defined in [private] repository's code-of-conduct: https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#7-attribution

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringer has failed to include the required statement of attribution despite being notified by myself and a member of [private]'s [private].

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

1. Adding the required statement of attribution as defined in [private] repository. (they have been notified that they are required to add this and have ignored my notifications thus far).  
2. Deletion of any offending content (i.e. the entire offending repository) if they fail to comply.  
3. Potential review of their account for other instances of copyright infringement.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

I believe, from a subjective viewpoint, that the offending content should simply be deleted and the user notified as to their violation, as it is clear that they had no intention of providing credit to [private] or the authors that have contributed actions to [private] repository.

They have actively removed information pertaining to such from their blatant duplicates of the content from [private] repository, and have thus far ignored requests to bring their repository into compliance with the respective license from [private] and [private]'s [private].

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

- Their Github profile is: https://github.com/Anil-matcha  
- Their [private] forum account is: [private]

I do not posses any other of their contact information at this time.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
