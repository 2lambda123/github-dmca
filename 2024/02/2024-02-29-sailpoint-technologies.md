Note that we reached out to thakurfurqaan on December 18, 2023, requesting that the infringing content be taken down and received no response.

We also reached out to [private] and [private] regarding the other two infringing repos and each of the people who posted the infringing content are no longer employed by their respective companies and those email addresses are invalid. Both [private] and [private] stated that they are not able to take the content posted by their prior-employees down directly, which is why I am submitting the DMCA request.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
