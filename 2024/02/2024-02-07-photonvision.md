**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

PhotonVision is an original work that [private], [private], have [private] and currently maintain under GPL v3

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A [private] to PhotonVision, known on GitHub as LaviRZ, has forked the project and redistributed it in violation of its license. This violation is a failure to provide full source disclosure for multiple Java Native Interface (JNI) modules, as required by GPLv3. This non-compliance constitutes a breach of the license and infringes on the copyright of PhotonVision.  
The infringing material can be found at: https://github.com/laviRZ/photonvision.

Note a complete lack of disclosure of source code for multiple Java Native Interface (JNI) modules referenced in the file RKNNJNI.java (https://github.com/laviRZ/photonvision/blob/d0ab820c867f98a00128c8073f7a12cc66f7e95f/photon-core/src/main/java/org/photonvision/vision/rknn/RKNNJNI.java), which calls native functions exported from the native library file “libjnish.so” (https://github.com/laviRZ/photonvision/blob/master/photon-core/src/main/resources/nativelibraries/linuxarm64/libjnish.so).

A [private] account controlled by the GitHub user LaviRZ asked for community assistance writing this JNI code, and was directed by myself and others to works licensed under GPLv3 as reference. Based on this, and I believe in good faith that the source codes used to create the native library described above are derived from similar works licensed under GPLv3, including
