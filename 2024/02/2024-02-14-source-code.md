Dear Github staff,

My name is [private] and I am a [private], [private], and [private]. A web page that your company hosts is infringing on code materials owned by [private].

[private] written work has been copied onto your servers without permission. The original written work [private] own can be found at: https://github.com/HasibAlMuzdadid/HasibAlMuzdadid.github.io  

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at: https://github.com/riponcm/riponcm.github.io

 

The Github user riponcm (https://github.com/riponcm ) has copied [private] whole repository that can be found at https://github.com/HasibAlMuzdadid/HasibAlMuzdadid.github.io . This user has copied the full repository and put that in his own repository claiming his own. He simply changed the picture and bio in the “index.html” file. Except this the whole repository is a copy of [private]. He has not changed the favicon yet which clearly states he has copied [private] work. Apart from this, he published [private] contact details, credentials, [private] research profile without taking [private] permission. He even has not changed the README.md file which represents [private] details. It came to my notice three days before. Noticing this, [private] slightly changed the codes to change the position of navigation bar, change the button shape from semi oval to semi square yesterday, you can check the commit history. These transformations are shown in the attached file.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform him of his duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify him to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.
