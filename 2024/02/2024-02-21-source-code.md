While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We have contracted the agreements with our customer, and have the authority to send DMCA takedowns on their behalf for the copyrighted content that is fraudulently posted to GitHub.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is the software source code of the customer's servo products SGD7S and SGD7W.  
“[private]” is included in the source code.  
The source [private] is also the [private] of the customer.  
Developer: [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down.   
https://github.com/minami-asakura/yaskawa-servo-sigma7

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Source code is managed in the customer's internal system, and files are stored for each version. File access is restricted to only the developer. Additionally, this source code is protected so that it can only run on a customer-specific SOC (system on chip).  
The customer has compared the file hash values leaked on GitHub with the file hash values of the stored source code and has confirmed that almost all files are from the customer.  
Other files are project files (derivative creations) that were created when Source Insight 4.0 was used to analyze the customer's source code, so these are also files related to the customer's source code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Unknown

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, we searched for forks of the allegedly infringing repository. All forks also should be taken down.
