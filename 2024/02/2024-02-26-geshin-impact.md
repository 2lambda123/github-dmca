**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the copyright owner of the game Genshin Impact.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As the copyright owner of the game, the codes of our game package are protected. Our website is https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

1. The entire repositories should be taken down:  
https://github.com/flswld/hk4e-go  
https://github.com/wkavenger/hk4e  
https://github.com/CokeSR/Hk4e-Go  
[invalid]  

2. Target:  
2.1 These repositories are specifically targeting our game by using the code "hk4e." The copyrighted work in question is Genshin Impact, and the repository names contain "hk4e," which is our internal code for Genshin Impact, used in various events related to the game (https://www.google.com/search?q=hk4e+site%3Amihoyo.com);  
2.2 The [README] sections of these four repositories (links below) all claim to serve the "Genshin Impact"（原神’s English） game, for which our company has not authorized the use of Genshin Impact game works nor the unauthorized establishment of game servers;  
https://github.com/flswld/hk4e-go/blob/main/README.md  
https://github.com/wkavenger/hk4e/blob/main/README.md  
https://github.com/CokeSR/Hk4e-Go?tab=readme-ov-file#readme  
[invalid]    

3. DRM  
In the same readme sections, it is declared that the client uses "[private]"("[private]") and "[private],"("[private]、[private]") which includes acts of cracking and modifying our company's game. These files also claim to have implemented a "[private]," ("[private]") indicating acts of cracking the game server communication protection measures;

These four repositories (taking the first one as an example) [https://github.com/flswld/hk4e-go/blob/main/protocol/cmd/cmd_id_proto_obj_map.go ] enable custom commands for player logins, exchanging paid items, etc., bypassing our game server's verification and paid purchase mechanisms;  

These four repositories (taking the first one as example) [https://github.com/flswld/hk4e-go/tree/main/protocol/hk4e_proto ] achieve communication with our game server by implementing the same communication interfaces and intercepting network requests, thus bypassing the game's server communication request verification and anti-piracy measures;

4. Legal Analysis  
The involvement of repositories in distributing unauthorized access to Genshin Impact, leveraging "hk4e" and offering cracked game services, infringes upon DRM protections as outlined by DMCA's Section 1201. This section explicitly prohibits circumventing copyright protection systems, including DRM, making it illegal to crack, modify, or distribute DRM-protected games.  
The activities described—ranging from reverse engineering to sharing cracked content—violate the law by bypassing DRM and other copyright safeguards implemented to secure the game against unauthorized replication or alteration.  
While DMCA Section 1201 allows certain exemptions, such as for legitimate research, these do not cover the commercial distribution of cracked content. Thus, the actions taken by these repositories clearly breach the legal barriers established to protect copyrighted works under the DMCA.  

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.
