**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I, [private], [private] at EC-Council International Limited (“EC-Council”), am the duly authorized representative of the copyright holder of the content that is being hosted on your servers without permission.

EC-Council owns the following trademarks and owns the copyright over the course and has full authority to report infringement containing the trademarks and copyrighted materials that are identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the Intellectual Property of EC-Council.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council. The practical material sourced from various cybersecurity courses of EC-Council official courses like “Certified Ethical Hacker”, is being unlawfully uploaded in the form of “CEH Practical” through your website without permission and in blatant violation of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, EC-Council is the owner and developer of the course “Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)” and owns copyright in all its versions which [private] has illegally uploaded through its GitHub Account. The customers seeking EC-Council’s courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients. We assert that this is a clear intent of riding freely on the goodwill of EC-Council.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
