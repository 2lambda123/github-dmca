As the [private] and [private] at Squire, I am the primary [private] and copyright holder of the software and automation plugins developed and sold by our company. Squire specializes in creating and distributing automation software solutions. Our products, which include a range of automation plugins, are the result of extensive research, development, and coding, primarily in Java, which [private] personally oversee.

The source code, algorithms, and functionality of these products are proprietary and protected under U.S. copyright law. These materials are original creations, developed through [private] expertise in software development and cybersecurity, and represent significant investments of time, resources, and intellectual property.

As the [private] of Squire and the [private] of the copyrighted material in question, I possess exclusive rights under copyright law. These rights include the distribution, reproduction, and adaptation of our software. The unauthorized upload and distribution of our source code not only infringe upon these rights but also harm our business and the interests of our clients who rely on the integrity and exclusivity of our software solutions.

Therefore, I am authorized to act on behalf of Squire in matters related to the protection of our intellectual property. This DMCA takedown request is submitted in [private] capacity as both the copyright owner and the [private] of Squire, seeking to address and rectify the unauthorized distribution and use of our copyrighted materials.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question consists of a comprehensive suite of automation plugins developed and sold by Squire. These plugins are designed to enhance productivity and automate complex tasks for our users. Our unique solutions are the result of extensive research and development, embodying advanced programming techniques, innovative algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces. The specific repository in question, located at https://github.com/WhoronaVirus/example-external-plugin, contains a direct copy of our proprietary software.

Our original work includes, but is not limited to:

Customized Algorithms: Each plugin features specialized algorithms developed in-house. These algorithms represent advanced programming and problem-solving efforts, tailored to specific automation tasks.

User Interface (UI) Design: The user interfaces of our plugins are designed for ease of use while offering powerful functionality. They are the result of careful planning and user experience research.

Source Code: The source code is written primarily in Java and is the product of countless hours of coding, testing, and refinement by our team.

Documentation: Accompanying documentation, including user guides, technical specifications, and developer notes, which are also proprietary.

The unauthorized repository replicates these components in full, without any alterations, thereby infringing on our copyright. This replication not only violates our exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute our software but also undermines our business by offering a free version of what we sell to sustain our operations.

For reference and comparison, the original versions of these plugins are available through our official distribution channels, which can be accessed at [private]. This URL showcases the legitimate and authorized versions of our software, affirming the originality and exclusive distribution rights held by Squire.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Squire employs a robust authentication system as a technological measure to control access to our copyrighted automation plugins. This system serves as a critical component of our intellectual property protection strategy. Key features of this system include:

User Authentication: Our system requires users to create an account and log in before they can access the full features of our plugins. This login process is secured with industry-standard encryption and authentication protocols, ensuring that only authorized users gain access.

License Verification: Each user is provided with a unique license key upon purchase or subscription. Our software verifies these keys before granting access to the plugins. This measure prevents unauthorized distribution and use of our software.

Encryption of Source Code: The source code of our plugins is encrypted. This encryption adds an additional layer of security, safeguarding our intellectual property from unauthorized viewing, copying, or modification.

Regular Updates and Security Patches: We regularly update our software to address any potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that our authentication system remains effective against new threats.

Audit Trails and Monitoring: Our system keeps detailed logs of access and usage. This monitoring helps in identifying and responding to any unauthorized access or usage patterns.

These measures are designed to effectively control access to our copyrighted material, ensuring that only authorized users, who have legally obtained our products, can use them. The unauthorized repository at https://github.com/WhoronaVirus/example-external-plugin bypasses these security protocols, allowing unrestricted access to our proprietary software. This not only violates our copyright but also undermines the effectiveness of our technological protection measures.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project, hosted at the unauthorized GitHub repository https://github.com/WhoronaVirus/example-external-plugin, is designed in a way that directly circumvents the technological protection measures we have carefully put in place at Squire. The following points illustrate this circumvention:

Bypassing User Authentication: Our software requires a secure login for access, ensuring that only authorized users can use our plugins. The accused project bypasses this by providing direct access to the software, without the need for user authentication. This allows any individual to access and use the software without our consent.

Ignoring License Verification: Each legitimate copy of our software checks for a valid license key. The repository in question offers a version of our software that does not perform this license verification, effectively nullifying our licensing control and allowing unrestricted use of our software.

Distribution of Decrypted Source Code: Our original source code is encrypted for security. The accused project appears to have decrypted or otherwise bypassed this encryption, offering an unprotected version of our source code. This not only allows unauthorized access but also makes it easier for others to modify and redistribute our software illegally.

Disabling Audit Trails and Monitoring: Our system includes mechanisms to monitor usage and detect unauthorized access. The software available in the accused repository likely has these features disabled, preventing us from tracking its unauthorized use and distribution.

In summary, the design and distribution of the software in the accused project effectively dismantle the security measures we have developed to protect our intellectual property. By providing a version of our software that bypasses user authentication and license verification, decrypts our protected source code, and disables our monitoring capabilities, the accused project allows and potentially encourages the unauthorized and uncontrolled use of our copyrighted material.
