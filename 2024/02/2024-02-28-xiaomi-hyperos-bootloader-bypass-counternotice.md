**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

i am [private] and [private] of MiTool in question. as such, i hold full ownership rights to the content. i have the necessary permissions to contest any actions related to the DMCA takedown request.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/offici5l/MiTool

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

my entire repository (MiTool) has been disabled based on a copyright claim! i've read the report filed at the following link: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/02/2024-02-07-xiaomi-hyperos-bootloader-bypass.md

firstly, i demand stricter reporting conditions to avoid unjust closures of developers' repositories, hindering their work. upon inspecting the claimant's repository, i noticed fundamental differences, such as the use of php ..., a language not present in my repositories. you can easily verify this.

furthermore, the reporter flagged unrelated links, including:

https://github.com/offici5l/MiTool/blob/main/MT/mitool  
https://github.com/offici5l/MiTool/blob/main/MT/mitoolV  
https://github.com/offici5l/MiTool/blob/main/install.sh

in summary, a comparison of the repositories will reveal that the claim is invalid. (such false claims disrupt my work.) i strongly request the swift reactivation of https://github.com/offici5l/MiTool

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
