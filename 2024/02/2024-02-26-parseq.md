**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of PARSeq and the [private] of its reference implementation in https://github.com/baudm/parseq/.  
The code is released under the Apache License and contains the copyright notice and license headers in all of the source files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A GitHub user, bharatsubedi, pulled my code, stripped all the license headers and copyright notice, and created a new repository here:  
 https://github.com/bharatsubedi/PARseq_torch

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[invalid]  
[invalid]  
https://github.com/bharatsubedi/PARseq_torch/blob/master/test.py

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Apache 2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The license stipulates that anyone who uses open source software licensed under Apache 2.0 must include the following in their copy of the code, whether they have modified it or not:

1. The original copyright notice  
2. A copy of the license itself  
3. If applicable, a statement of any significant changes made to the original code  
4. A copy of the NOTICE file with attribution notes

I believe that the 1, 2, and 4 are most essential, however, most of the license and copyright headers have been stripped from the files. The LICENSE and NOTICE files are missing too.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

I've reached out to the user last Apr 2023 (https://github.com/bharatsubedi/PARseq_torch/issues/4) but received no reply. The user must add all headers and copyright notices back to each file.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

https://github.com/bharatsubedi/

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
