We are the small and non-github based team associated by the voluntary member.  
Actual copyright holder [private] asked me to stress DMCA violation to the target repository user because he is not so fluent at English communication.

We have created SPFM series FM sound chip player hardware and software.  
Regarding the hardware the product originator has been selling this product at [private].  
But for the software, we have published our work only binary and simple instructions.

The DCMA takedown target is here: [private]  
At this repositories, some of SPFM relevant repositories were simply copied from our original website. That is why he must not have original source codes.
Most significant point is these repository owner wrongly and willfully changed the license from our rights base to MIT, these software and binary owner is very us(and strictly [private]), target repositories license MD were totally wrong and violating our rights.

In this time, denjhang again intentionally has attempted putting our SW properties by anagrammed repository name.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Following repositories entirely:  
https://github.com/denjhang/SPFM-Tower

https://github.com/denjhang/ICCS

Especially, latter two repositories above are extremely malicious because he intentionally has put our SW properties again by changing repository name reversing left and right.
