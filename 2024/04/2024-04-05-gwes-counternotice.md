The GWES License (Known as the ERN LIDS License) that was applied to this software never stated who owned the software, as the creator of said license did not want to claim all software under the license. It only specifies what end-users could do with said software. This license was invalidated with the disbanding of the GWES ERN Network Development team when both the Lead Network Developer and the Lead Systems Developer were both forcefully removed from the program.

For the CAPDEC, I am the [private] of said software, and the [private].  
This was written under a FEMA MOA, however that is not a legally binding contract, nor maintains how code is supposed to be used.  
GWES submitted a control scheme used by them for payment of this software, however that code has been removed.  
This software was in development before the GWES ERN even existed.  
All code posted was [private], and was copyrighted under "[private]" (now M[private]).

The CAP-Server application was a complete rewrite of the original GWES CAP-Server due to many issues and complaints with the old system, but was never used in GWES ERN except for background testing by WACN Technologies. This code was not written nor maintained by any GWES Member, does not include any hidden keys.

ASMARA is not, was never, and will not be owned by GWES.  
On the old GIT server it was hosted on, GWES as a whole has only committed 2 changes, both of which have been superseded.   
This software was also copyright under "[private]", and not GWES.

The ENDEC Logger software was never covered under any license by both GWES nor [private] (Now [private]), nor copyrighted or owned by anyone, but was written and maintained by [private]. They are open-source.

This software was likely removed out of spite, due to GWES ERN management having a large debate on this trying to claim ownership of all of these softwares before removal of [private] (Now [private]) from their program.

The ERN LIDS license is as follows:

Global Weather and EAS Society EAS Relay Network License for Internally Developed Software  
Internally developed software developed by the Network Development team ("ERN-ND") is granted to those who have access as a privilege, not a right.  
As such, ERN-ND can take away access to said software under this license agreement. Usage of the software means that you, the end user, agree to all provisions within this agreement.  
Alright, now that the legal stuff is out of the way, here is what you can do under this license agreement:  
- Use the software  
- Make changes to the configuration of the software  
- If access was granted by ERN-ND, modifications to the source code are allowed, however the changes are limited to:  
- Quality of Life  
- Extended functionality in specific applications  
- Aesthetic modifications  
- Porting to unsupported platforms  
These changes are allowed under the condition that:  
- Source code modifications are made available to ERN-ND  
- They are not designed to bypass security regarding Software Licensing or gaining access to IPAWS.  
- You declare to ERN-ND that by modifying the software, you are relinquishing any further support for software issues regarding the modfications unless the modifications make it into the main source tree using a pull request that is approved.  
- This license is retained within the software in a unmodified state.   
Here is what you can't do:  
- Make unauthorized changes to the software  
- Reverse engineer the software  
- Bypass the activation of the software  
- Redistribute the software  
- Run the software on any electronic device that is owned (or hosted) by an individual not bound under this license agreement  
- Attempt to retrieve the GWES-ERN IPAWS Access Key without express authorization by the Network Operations team.  
Violations of this agreement will result in removal of access to any software that is developed under this agreement and may prevent you from being eligible for further software access indefinitely.  
TL;DR- You can use the software, change the software config, and make modifications as long as they are not extensive and code is made available to network devs. Just know we won't help you if you break it.  
Any violations will make you look like a jackass and access will be revoked as needed. You wouldn't download a car so why steal shit you don't own.
