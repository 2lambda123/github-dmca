I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I representing the [private] of Shenzhen Anyin Technology Co., Ltd. Recently, we discovered that a repository on GitHub,https://github.com/gensir/anyinNewItem, contains our company's source code, project published 6 years ago.This code is our company's property, containing trade secrets and intellectual property, and it has been published without our company's formal authorization.

We understand the importance GitHub places on supporting open-source projects and collaboration. However, the unauthorized disclosure of private source code constitutes a serious infringement of our company's copyright. I have read and understood GitHub's "DMCA Takedown Notice Guide." In accordance with the DMCA, we formally request the removal or disabling of the content involved in the above link.

The project in question is the "Anyin Electronic Seal Management Platform Project," which consists of our company's frontend source code from 2017 to 2018.

Numerous references to "Anyin Electronic Seal Management Platform" can be readily found in the code. Additionally, the commit history uploaded in the project corresponds to the historical records of submissions made by our company's employees at that time.

I've contacted the author via email([private]) and pull, but I haven't received a response.I hope the platform can delete this code.

The author of github should be a former employee of our company, but he cannot be contacted currently, and he has not used github for several years.
