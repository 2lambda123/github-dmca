**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the [private] and [private] of Blazorise (https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise), a component library for Blazor that [private] building for the past 5+ years. It has a dual license. It is open-source and free to use by individuals, and it has a commercial license for companies. The full SLA can be found at https://blazorise.com/files/licences/SLA-2023-07.pdf

I have contacted the person who is using my code. Their repository is on https://github.com/vikramlearning/blazorbootstrap. I have contacted them several times over the past months and even asked them publicly.

- https://github.com/vikramlearning/blazorbootstrap/issues/563, and

After they ignored my request and locked the conversation, I responded once more.

- https://github.com/vikramlearning/blazorbootstrap/issues/572

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Their core code is based on Blazorise, from

- https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/blob/master/Source/Blazorise/Base/BaseComponent.cs  
- https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/blob/master/Source/Blazorise/Base/BaseAfterRenderComponent.cs  
- https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/blob/master/Source/Blazorise/Providers/ClassProvider.cs  
- https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/blob/master/Source/Blazorise/Providers/StyleProvider.cs

And basically, every component under BaseComponent uses those parts of code.

There are more codes that can be easily detected.

After I contacted them last week, they started to rename and shuffle the code to obfuscate it, but everything can be seen in Git history.

This is the commit with obfuscated and renamed parts: https://github.com/vikramlearning/blazorbootstrap/commit/1389d869a1ef5d4a624fb57fc796e6b9945dfaa5

It can be seen that there is quite a lot of code involved.

For anyone who understands the code, it is evident that it is still working as before, just in different places.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Entire repository: https://github.com/vikramlearning/blazorbootstrap

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, that is the base repository. There are probably more forks of his work from the community.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

It is licensed under dual licenses. Open-sourced under the APACHE 2.0 and a commercial license for organizations.

https://blazorise.com/files/licences/SLA-2023-07.pdf

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Our SLA says that the Blazorise code can only be used by individuals under the APACHE 2.0 license. Since he cloned Blazorise code and publically shared it, and people are downloading it, there is a possibility that those other people are subject to Blazorise's business license if they are using it under the organization.

The person who cloned the code is also not mentioning the Blazorise license anywhere and has been trying to ignore us for months.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

I have asked the persons involved several times to at least add the attribution mentioned. They ignored the requests, and I don't see that they would change their mind in a friendly manner.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
