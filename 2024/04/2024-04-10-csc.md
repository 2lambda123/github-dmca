I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice

 

Dear Sirs,

We are Corporation Service Company (CSC), a brand and internet monitoring company.  We have been instructed by Trip.com Travel Singapore Pte. Ltd (“Trip.com”) to take action in relation to online infringements on their intellectual property rights. Please find the attached letter of authorization, which has been obfuscated for privacy protection purposes.

 

Our client is a well-known multinational travel service company with over 400 million members, making it one of the leading online travel agencies globally. Specializing in international travel by operating in 200 countries and regions, and with over 1.4 million hotels around the world they have built an extensive international reputation. They primarily operate from their official website: https://us.trip.com/?locale=en-us.

 

We have been alerted to your website, https://github.com/, which appears to be offering our client’s copyrighted software without any authorization. These were brought to our attention by you as forked repositories: https://github.com/55sec/rule-engine/network/members. Please note, we identified related forked files listed below, which our client would like to have disabled.

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. The codes offered on this website show the project was created on 21 October 2015, but its code committing time on Github does start on 13 October 2015. This could prove that this uploader is not likely to be the original author, And the time he copied the code is after Trip.com developed. Please see attached images highlighting dates created and records of the code in our client’s database.
