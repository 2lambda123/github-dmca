**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I, [private], certify under penalty of perjury, that I am an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner HashiCorp, Inc. ("HashiCorp") of certain intellectual property rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

HashiCorp is the maker of Terraform, an infrastructure as code software tool that allows users to manage environments with a configuration language called the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for human-readable, automated deployments. Terraform's repository is located at: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform. At least five of the files located on that repository have been infringed: (1) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/refactoring/remove_statement.go, (2) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed.go, (3) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed_test.go, (4), https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed_test.go, and (5) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/addrs/remove_endpoint_test.go. These files, first published in November of 2023, are subject to HashiCorp's Business Software License ("BSL"), which provides, among other terms, that (1) all copies of the Licensed Work (as defined in BSL) and derivative works of the Licensed Work, are subject to the BSL, (2) the licensee must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy of the Licensed Work, and (3) any use of the Licensed Work in violation of the license will automatically terminate your rights under this License for the current and all other versions of the Licensed Work.

HashiCorp's Terraform was forked by the OpenTofu project in late August of 2023, after HashiCorp announced in early August of 2023 that would distribute Terraform under BSL going forward. The Terraform files identified above have been infringed by OpenTofu, which has published the following files that include code that is the same as and/or slightly modified from the original corresponding Terraform Files. Each of the following Open Tofu's files contain substantial overlap with the code and comments contained in the original Terraform Files: (1) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/refactoring/remove_statement.go, (2) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed.go, (3) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed_test.go, (4) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/configs/removed_test.go, and (5) https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/internal/addrs/remove_endpoint_test.go. While the referenced OpenTofu Files include some new code, much of their contents comprise HashiCorp BSL code in its original unmodified form, as well as sections where OpenTofu has made minor modifications to the original HashiCorp code such as altering the names of packages and variables, and revising explanatory comments. Notably, OpenTofu has removed HashiCorp’s BSL license designation and replaced it with an MPL license designation, in violation of BSL. As derivative works of the Terraform Files, the OpenTofu Files are required to be governed by the BSL. Redistribution under MPL is not authorized by HashiCorp.
