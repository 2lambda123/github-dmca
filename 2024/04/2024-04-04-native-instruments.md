Dear Sir or Madam, 

I would like to submit a Take Down Notice on behalf of Native Instruments GmbH, [private], [private]. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

Native Instruments is a well-known and global music technology provider that develops and commercially distributes so-called "plugins", i.e. software components that can be integrated into our customers' music programs to generate, edit and playback virtual instruments, sound effects and other audio content. Most of our plugins are sold on a perpetual basis to our customers. Each customer who purchases our products agrees to comply with the terms of our End User License Agreement. Section 3.1 of our EULA expressly forbids to reverse engineer our proprietary software products. 
 
It has come to our attention that the [private] user "[private]" created a [private] site that specifically describes how products from Native Instruments can be reverse engineered. The site is expressly dedicated as a "reverse engineering effort for the Native Instruments file formats." [private] encourages other users to contribute to these reverse engineering efforts. 

This reverse engineering attempt violates our EULA and constitutes a breach of applicable copyright and trade secret laws. Our software products are of a proprietary nature exclusively and do not contain any open source elements that would oblige us to disclose the source code or tolerate any reserve engineering attempts. 

Therefore, this [private] site of your user "[private]" represents a significant business risk for Native Instruments, which can lead to considerable financial damage. 

We hereby request you to take down and remove the Github site "https://github.com/monomadic/ni-file" immediately and confirm the takedown in writing. 

If we do not receive your written notice until April 5, 2024 at the latest, we may consider to take further legal action against you in view of your accountability as hosting provider. 

In addition, we request you to provide us with contact details of your user "[private]", so that we can send a cease and desist letter and initiate other legal means, if needed. 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Kind regards,  
[private]
