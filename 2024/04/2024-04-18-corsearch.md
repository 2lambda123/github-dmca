Subject: CEASE AND DESIST – ‘GogoAnime API’  
 
Dear GitHub Inc.,
 
This notice is being issued by Corsearch Inc. (“Corsearch”) on behalf of AXN Investment, Inc. (the
“Rightsholder”), the owner of exclusive rights in a vast catalogue of copyright protected anime content which is
being infringed by the platform referred to in this notice. A representative list of such content has been included
as Appendix 1 (“Infringed Content”).  
Evidence of Corsearch’s authority to act on behalf of the Rightsholder can be found in the attached enclosure
to this email.
 
It has come to our attention, that one of your customers, namely ‘riimuru’ (URL: https://github.com/riimuru), has
been utilizing the online services that GitHub Inc. ("GitHub”) provides to facilitate and/or enable unauthorized
access to numerous works infringing upon the exclusive rights of the Rightsholder.
User ‘riimuru’ has been knowingly providing access to the GogoAnime API, which is available for download
from your GitHub repository at https://github.com/riimuru/gogoanime-api. GogoAnime API enables unauthorized
access to anime content, an activity that is well established as copyright infringement under applicable laws,
and relevant case law. Examples of GogoAnime API facilitating infringement have been attached in Appendix
2.
 
The unauthorized distribution or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement
under the Copyright Act, Title 17 U.S Code Section 106(3)-(4), and comparable laws in other countries.
GogoAnime API’s conduct may also violate the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works and The Universal Copyright Convention, as well as bilateral treaties with other countries that allow for
the protection of Rightsholders' interest in copyrighted works.
 
In light of the foregoing, we are asking that you immediately remove GogoAnime API from your Repository and
disable access to GogoAnime API on your Repository in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512(c) (“DMCA") and/or as per the GitHub Inc.'s terms of service,
which prohibits use of your facilities for copyright infringement as stated on your website:
 
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy.
 
Infringing repository: https://github.com/riimuru/gogoanime-api
 
We also request the removal of the following forks of the GogoAnime API including but not limited to:
 
https://github.com/riimuru/gogoanime-api/network/members

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing
to the same extent as the parent repository.
 
We have a good faith belief that the use of the Infringed Content owned and/or controlled by the Rightsholder in
the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law. The information
contained in this notice is accurate. Under the penalty of perjury, Corsearch is authorized to act on behalf of the
Rightsholder.
 
This letter is without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the Rightsholder, all of which are expressly reserved.
 
Sincerely,
