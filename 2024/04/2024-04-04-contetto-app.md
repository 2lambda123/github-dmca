I am the [private] and the [private] in the org Contetto-app (https://github.com/contetto-app)  
We recently change the org name from "[private]" to "contetto-app" because of our business needs.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All repositories in the [private] (originally "[private]") organization are private and owned by our org [private] and nobody are allowed to make them public especially those ones who don't support the development.

Here are the repositories that are infringed  
[private]  
[private] [private]  
[private] [private]  
[private] [private]  
[private] [private]  
[private]  
[private]  

above repositories and all files inside them are copyrighted work and have been infringed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We invited a guy "[private]" (not sure what the actual name is) into our organization for some outsourcing work (since we don't have much time atm), but the guy couldn't finish the assigned tasks as expected, so we fired him... But the guy decided to make our private repositories public in his own organization/repositories without any permission. He didn't write anything in our repositories.

Here are the repositories:  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-backend  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-ava-simple-demo  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-admin-app  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-ava-mobile  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-ava-desktop  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-terraform-ecs  
https://github.com/Stefan-AVA/ava-contetto-mls-sync

All repositories and files under that org (https://github.com/Stefan-AVA) should be taken down.

Actually, the guy made that organization to attack us.
