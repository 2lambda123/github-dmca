Hello, I am an employee of [private]. My company mainly contracts projects of China Unicom Group. More than two years ago, a project of China Unicom that I was responsible for developing was uploaded to the warehouse of GitHub. Recently, China Unicom Group found through the Internet that the content of the project I uploaded contained words such as “联通云". The copyright of this project belongs to China Unicom, the copyright registration number is 57252149. I immediately removed my infringing project, but still found that other gitHub users had copied my project completely.  
You can see that all the commits came from me and no one else. I own everything as you can see from the commits https://github.com/enterpriseih/wangxiangwebsite/commits. The hosted content is an exact copy of my work.
