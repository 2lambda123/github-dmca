I have already read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I represent [private], which is a [private] company with company registration code: [private] registered in [private].

We have software([private]) that was developed in-house and one of our [private] uploaded it to GitHub and made it public. We notified this former [private] who promptly deleted the content, but anothers has a copy. We made contact for deletion, but he did not respond to our messages.It contains a lot of private information.
For example, It contains the company’s tee system technology implementation plan in [private]
also in [private],Involving the card swiping code logic of Pax Company’s M8 project.  
in [private],Involving the hardware schematic diagram and software switching principle of Pax Company's M8 project.  
There are many documents involving the privacy of Pax Company, so I won’t give examples one by one, as there are security risks.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All contents of the following repository have been deleted.

However, the content can still be found in the link below. If personal information is involved, please delete it.

Therefore I am asking Github would take action immediately, take down the projects listed above, and their forked versions also.

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web page is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
