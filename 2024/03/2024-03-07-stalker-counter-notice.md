Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of this content and hold full copyright ownership of it. All materials presented in [private] repository were [private] created by [private] and [private], do not infringe upon any third-party copyrights, and fully comply with GitHub's terms of use.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe that [private] repository was mistakenly removed due to the phrase "stalker 2" in its title. However, it's crucial to emphasize that the number "2" in the name of [private] repository is used as a preposition "to", forming the phrase "stalker to ue". This indicates the direction of [private] project and is not a direct reference to the game Stalker 2.

I also suspect that [private] repository might have been caught in a general wave of bans related to leaks of the Stalker 2 game. However, I want to stress that [private] repository does not contain any materials related to the Stalker 2 game and does not violate any copyrights or GitHub's terms of use.

[private] project is entirely original and not associated with the mentioned game or its content. I hope this information will help clarify the situation and confirm that the removal of [private] repository was the result of a misunderstanding.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
