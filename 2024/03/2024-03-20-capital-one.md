This DMCA Takedown Notice is issued on behalf of Capital One. The following four GitHub repositories were posted on January 16, 2024 by GitHub account ‘noodyisme’ with commits by account ‘[private],’ and, in their entirety, contain confidential and proprietary code belonging to Capital One: 



https://github.com/noodyisme/oizvhxclkansdfjkasdnfjkasdlf

https://github.com/noodyisme/ajsiuvhkclkjxzvhhasidfl

https://github.com/noodyisme/adfdasfCSCdsfasdfasdgfadg

https://github.com/noodyisme/afdsiuhalsdkvmncxzgyfriuaekf


All four repositories were directly lifted from Capital One’s internal [private] platform for [private], an internal Capital One product. At multiple points, the repositories link to internal Capital One [private], internal [private], and other internal Capital One resources that are not publicly available. We also believe the repositories were renamed in a failed attempt to obfuscate their discovery. 


The four repositories are linked below in the original, internal Capital One [private] environment, which can also be seen in the commit history for the four repositories posted by ‘noodyisme:’

Our [private] has undergone a thorough investigation to determine the identity of the source of this code exfiltration. After exhausting these resources, we were unable to determine the individual behind the exfiltration. The [private] sent a takedown demand to the email address associated with this GitHub account, [private], on March 15, 2024, but we have not received a response to date. 


We ask that both ‘noodyisme’ and ‘[private]’ take down and delete all four repositories and delete all confidential and proprietary code in their possession. In addition, we ask them to identify how or from whom they received this Capital One code to post externally. 


 I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
