**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

As one of the [private] of AtlantisRP, the company in question, I am authorized to act on behalf of the company in matters concerning intellectual property rights, including copyright infringement claims. AtlantisRP holds all rights to its logo and name, including both image and copyright, which have been used without authorization.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed is a reference to our company, AtlantisRP, including the logo and name. This information is prominently displayed on our official website at atlantisrp.it, along with other branding elements and company information. Its unauthorized use in the mentioned repository, coupled with inaccuracies and poor presentation, poses a significant reputational risk to our company. Our company's name and associated details being utilized without authorization in an unaffiliated and poorly executed context undermine our brand image and credibility. Furthermore, it's important to note that our company has had prior dealings with the individual associated with this repository. However, this repository has no affiliation with the project published at the indicated address. The presence of unauthorized use of our company's name and the dissemination of poor-quality code misattributed to us only serve to damage our brand reputation.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The specific file that should be taken down is the README.md file within the repository located at https://github.com/marcocusano/minecraft-roleplay?tab=readme-ov-file#testimonials.
