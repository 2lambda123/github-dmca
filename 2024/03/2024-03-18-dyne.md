I, [private], as the [private] ([private]) of DYNE Technologies Inc., assert our company's exclusive copyright ownership of the specific proprietary codebase developed for our web application's frontend. This codebase represents original creative work that is a product of substantial investment in terms of time, resources, and expertise. It is protected under copyright law as it embodies original expression in the form of source code that facilitates the distinct functions and features of our web application.

As [private], [private] am entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding our company's intellectual property and maintaining the confidentiality of our proprietary assets. [private] position authorizes me to act on behalf of DYNE Technologies Inc. in matters pertaining to the enforcement of our copyright and to address any unauthorized use or disclosure of our copyrighted materials. My actions are in accordance with the policies of our company and the legal agreements that bind entities and individuals who have been granted access to our sensitive information under strict confidentiality terms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work in question is a comprehensive and sophisticated codebase that serves as the foundation of our web application's frontend interface. It is a unique and intricate arrangement of source code that includes proprietary algorithms, custom-built functionalities, user interface design elements, and system operations that are integral to the user experience and operational efficiency of our web application.

This codebase is not available to the public and is securely housed within our private [private] org here: [private], where access is restricted to authorized personnel who have agreed to confidentiality provisions. The work is a testament to DYNE Technologies Inc.'s innovation and is crucial to maintaining our competitive position within the industry.

The copyrighted material includes, but is not limited to:  
- Environment variable configurations that are essential for the security and proper functioning of our web application.  
- Internal processes that dictate the workflow and business logic unique to our company's services.  
- Operational code that manages data transactions and user interactions within the application.  
- The structural layout of our codebase, which details the organization and modular design of our software, allowing for scalability and maintainability.  
API connection routines that handle the communication between our frontend and backend services, developed to optimize performance and data integrity.  

The infringement consists of a direct, unaltered duplication of this codebase, which has been made publicly accessible without authorization. The proprietary nature of the work and its significance to our company's operations underscore the gravity of the infringement and the potential harm to our business interests.

This public repo has since been taken down, and a response from github was received ([private]) which requested we reupload with additional evidence, but we have no certainty as to whether it has resurfaced elsewhere on the internet. I have recorded screenshots and a [private] video of the account before it was taken down here: [private] (please redact this link)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following specific files, as part of the entire repository, have been identified for immediate takedown:  
The root directory of the repository at https://github.com/Aditya9839521731/appicdyan, including all branches and commits that contain DYNE Technologies Inc.'s proprietary code and data. It is unclear whether this has been made private or if it has been copied to another entity within the [private] organization. Your aid in the due diligence of these matters is requested.

The entire repository, including all its files and historical commits, should be removed from GitHub to ensure that our confidential and proprietary information is no longer accessible to the public or any unauthorized parties. Additionally, we request that GitHub takes precautionary measures to prevent the re-uploading or dissemination of this content in the future.

We request that GitHub acknowledges this takedown notice and enforces the immediate removal of the content to mitigate any further damages to our company's intellectual property rights and business interests. We also ask GitHub to provide confirmation once the takedown action has been completed.
