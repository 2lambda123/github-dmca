Dear GitHub Support Team

I mistakenly uploaded the company's core code to githup and made the code public, and now the company has found out and asked me to delete the codebase I uploaded, and at the moment I have deleted my codebase. But I found out that there were other people who forked my codebase, and I couldn't reach the user who forked my codebase, so I can only ask you to help me remove it.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to disable and remove the mentioned repository. The unauthorized distribution of [private] software not only undermines the principles of fair use but also poses a substantial threat to the integrity, security, and reputation of the application.

Please understand the u

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Since I've left my original company and I've removed the original codebase, I don't know how to provide more evidence. But you can see that in the corresponding fork branch, the first commit code was committed by [private], please help me delete the branch forked from [private], otherwise I'll get in trouble, please!
