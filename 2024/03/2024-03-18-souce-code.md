We have an internally developed software and have applied for a software copyright certificate, which can prove that the code belongs to the company's ownership and is protected by copyright. However, one of our [private] uploaded it to GitHub and made it public. We notified the former [private] and he promptly deleted the content, but we found that someone else had copied it. We contacted him to delete it, but he did not reply to our message. Therefore, we hope to get your help to help us delete the corresponding project to protect our property rights.  
I submitted the software copyright certificate for this software through email. I cannot provide a URL to prove that all the code belongs to this project, but there is a relevant introduction to the software's functions on our company's official website. Please refer to it. The link address is:
