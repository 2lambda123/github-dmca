We have an internally developed software and applied for a software copyright certificate, which can prove that the code belongs to the company and is protected by copyright. However, one of our [private] uploaded it to GitHub and made it public. We notified the former [private] and he immediately deleted the content, but we found that someone copied the content. The two forks we detected earlier have been removed with your help, and you reminded us that there are still new branches. We checked the forks you listed and found that these forks are complete copies of the content of the original project. Therefore, we still need your help to delete the corresponding projects. Thank you very much.
Meanwhile, according to our current review results, we believe that all or most of the forks are the same as the original project, so we hope to disable the project on the whole network. Thank you again.  
In the future, I will still submit the software copyright certificate of the software through email.Meanwhile, there is a related introduction about the functions of the software on our company's official website.Please refer to it.The link address is:
