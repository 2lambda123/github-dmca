This user has published and is sharing copyrighted code that belongs to [private] as the [private] and [private]. [private] created the CMS theme: https://vinvictustheme.com/ the code they are sharing (via Mega.nz link) is a custom commissioned version of that theme for [private] client. This is the demo theme they are sharing: https://hellscream.vinvictustheme.com/ and this is the website they stole it from: https://hellscreamwow.com/

This user is from a game server for World of Warcraft, which was recently reported to their hosting provider ([private]) for using [private] stolen theme and game core which belongs to [private] client, I believe it has been taken down. This is their website : [private]  

[private] took advantage of the [private] owner's trust by pretending to be a [private] to fix bugs. Unfortunately, this granted them full access to the server, enabling them to download everything. Now, they're using these stolen files to host their own server and monetize it. Because they were reported by many in the community for using stolen content, they are now sharing the data on your website.
