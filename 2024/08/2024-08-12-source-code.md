Developer [private] provided [private], [private], with development services in accordance with the service and confidentiality agreements signed by us (links to the agreements below). [private] GitHub is https://github.com/flayder/, and [private] GitHub, where I received the work, is [private]. Yesterday, [private] rejected part of [private] work and declined it (meaning [private] don't need the code for that part). [private] offered to compensate him for a portion of the hours spent (considering that [private] will not receive the code). [private] decided to refuse compensation and, to harm [private], published [private] code from the repository [private], which was originally developed by another developer, not [private].

Today, [private] violated sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 of the Confidentiality Agreement by publishing the code that was previously paid for. Link to the agreement (the file contains the English translation first, followed by the signed copy) - [private]
