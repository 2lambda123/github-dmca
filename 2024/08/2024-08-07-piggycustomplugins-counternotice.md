I am the [private] of all of the work on [private] github (https://github.com/xsmar/OzPluginsPublic) and have a claim made by the GitHub username [private], [private] of [private].

Work was requested to be done. A previous GitHub of [private], [private] contained the mentioned code claimed by the copyright accuser. This GitHub was removed to code add to [private], which was rebranded before payment was even discussed as part of previous talks. No TOS was agreed upon.

The latest license at the time for [private] was a GNU GPL license.

The entire GitHub was taken down, URL: https://github.com/xsmar/OzPluginsPublic

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

A TOS was never officially agreed to as a final version never came to completion.

The license of [private] up until before I was removed was a GNU GPL License. The intent of this private GitHub is to sell plugins to customers, Code in this GitHub belongs to another GitHub: [private]

Specifically, [invalid], which would break the AGPL-3.0 license currently live on [private].

My [private] (https://github.com/xsmar/OzPluginsPublic) fully complied with the AGPL-3.0 licence [private] which my project takes inspiration from.
