**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] for VaultCord, an online software service. I hold copyright ownership over the works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is my Javascript code used to control [private] website and communicate with my API. The only authorized URL is https://cdn.vaultcord.com/verify-1-0.js

This GitHub repository, among other copyright violations, has illegally hosted my code without permission from me https://github.com/n0ctrn3/VaultCord-Bypass/blob/main/scripts/verify-1-0.js

The 2nd line of the verify-1-0.js states "This code is NOT open source", meaning permission is needed to re-host my original code. Permission was never obtained and this repository is used to circumvent and violate my copyright even further.

This repository also violates §5 of my Terms of Service, prohibiting automation of [private] website https://vaultcord.com/terms#userreps

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/n0ctrn3/VaultCord-Bypass

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I employ VPN checks and also check the fraud score of client's IP address [private]  

Additionally, browser fingerprinting is used to prevent suspicious activity on my website.

I also host my Javascript code on [private] website with explicit copyright notices https://github.com/n0ctrn3/VaultCord-Bypass/blob/main/scripts/verify-1-0.js and the author has stolen this code and re-uploaded it & modified it without permission from me, the copyright owner.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

There is a clear violation of the DMCA anti-circumvention clause. The author states that the GitHub project is "designed to bypass the VaultCord verification system" in the About section of the repository.

"Vault Cord protection should now be bypassed" in https://github.com/n0ctrn3/VaultCord-Bypass/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L78
