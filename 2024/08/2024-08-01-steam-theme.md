**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the original work. [private] created the project 'Steam' and published it under the MIT license on GitHub. The original repository is available at [private] https://github.com/SpaceTheme and the URL https://github.com/SpaceTheme/Steam

Changing the name in the License to "SpaceTheme"
