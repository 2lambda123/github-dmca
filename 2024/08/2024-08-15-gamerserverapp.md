**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

GameServerApp is the copyright owner, and I am the [private] of GameServerApp.  
[private] wrote the script with private] hands. It has been stored on [private] for a while.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is the original script, of which I am the [private], and it is part of [private] company's (GameServerApp) intellectual property.
https://github.com/gameserverapp/Platform/blob/main/Downloads/DediConnect/install-script_windows-server-2022.ps1

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This file (link below) is a copy of [private] work. [private] added some comments and changed some parts of the code a bit. However, the built up of the code is identical, the command used are nearly identical and it installs the same software, except a couple things that [private] removed from the original script.

[private] copied [private] work, changed it a bit, and published [private] code under a MIT license, without [private] permission.

I sent [private] a cease and desist email prior to us finding evidence that he was infringing our intellectual property, as we received evidence that he was planning to "be inspired" by GameServerApp. In reply to [private] Cease and Desist email, [private] told [private] to "go walk the dog".  
We have evidence, based on GameServerApp system logs, that [private] accessed GameServerApp systems a week before publishing this file and we have strong suspicions that this is when [private] copied our script and other copyright protected files (which are not published on Github).

[private] is using this script to run a project called "Game Admin App", and claims on his website: "It is offered free of charge at the moment.", which suggests it will be commercialized in the future (https://gameadmin.app/).

Please remove this script and all its historic versions from Github:

No
