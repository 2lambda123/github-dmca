---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Due to continuous abuse of my projects by the GitHub community, I am bringing all my automation tools into [private]. People are submitting my works to universities, to their prospective employers, and even use at their commercial projects without authorization!

I read the "According to Section D5 of GitHub's Terms of Service, by making a repository public, you agree that it may be viewed and forked by others. Therefore, simply forking a public repository is generally not considered copyright infringement. If we've misunderstood the nature of your complaint, please revise your notice to indicate how the allegedly infringing user has violated your copyright, without contradicting our Terms of Service."

But GitHub failed to explain what would happen after making the repositories public — "Be prepared that people would steal your work and authorship rights! Be ready that they will submit your works to universities, to their prospective employers, and even use at their commercial projects without authorization!"

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
