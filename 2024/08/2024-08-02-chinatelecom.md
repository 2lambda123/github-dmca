Github Team：  
The undersigned declares:  
[1] I have read and understood GitHub's DMCA Notice Submission Guidelines;  
[2] I am a person injured by infringement of U.S. copyright law, specifically 17 U.S.C. § 501 (commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or "DMCA"), or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the injured party;  
[3] I can be contacted via the following information:  
Company Name: China Telecom Digital Life Technology Co., Ltd.  
Full Name: [private]  
Title:[private]  
Email: [private]  
Address: [private]  

China Telecom Digital Life Technology Co., Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Telecom Group focusing on the digital life sector, hereinafter referred to as "our company". We have discovered that a GitHub user has illegally uploaded our project code in their GitHub repository, leading to a source code leak and causing serious security risks for our company. Reasons:

The homewifi-mesh project source code uploaded by GitHub user bellmit was originally posted by GitHub user "[private]", who is an employee of our company named [private] with phone number [private] and email [private]. This employee was held accountable by the company for uploading the project code (homewifi-mesh) and subsequently removed the relevant code from GitHub. GitHub can verify this through user logs. Please see the image "Company Code Warehouse Record.png".  
The homewifi-mesh project is primarily used for our company's China Telecom Gateway-related business. The China Telecom Gateway is an independently developed smart gateway by China Telecom, and its interfaces are for internal use only and not open to the public. Furthermore, the domain name "189cube.com" mentioned in the code is owned by our company. Please see the image "Domain certificate.jpg".  
A comparison of the code similarity shows that our R&D cloud platform stores the homewifi-mesh source code updated by "[private]" in June 2023. The left side of the images represents screenshots from our R&D cloud platform, while the right side shows the code stored on GitHub, which is essentially identical. Please see the images "Code comparison-1.png" and "Code comparison-2.png".  
The code contains critical sensitive information, including domain names, IP addresses, API invocation IDs, database access permissions, and SFTP access permissions, posing significant security risks.  
Therefore, our company requests that the GitHub team remove the infringing project from the GitHub user's repository and ensure that similar code uploads do not occur in the future. The URL of the infringing project is:   https://github.com/bellmit/WorkingProject/tree/master/homewifi-mesh

I swear that the information in this notice is accurate and that I am the owner of the copyright allegedly infringed, or I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, under penalty of perjury.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
