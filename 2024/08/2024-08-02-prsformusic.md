**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorised representative of PRS for Music Ltd, the copyright holder, employed to protect the cyber security posture of the organisation. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

PRS for Music's public website, available at https://www.prsformusic.com/ has been saved as static files into the repo linked.   Because this is hosted on github.io, this means that a clone of PRS for Music's website is published on the internet, which is a concern from the point of view of reputational risk if our members were to visit the cloned website.  
This can be mitigated by disabling the github.io hosting for this page, or making the repo/page private so it is not published to the internet. Alternatively, PRS copyright content should be removed from the repo.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
