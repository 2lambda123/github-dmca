**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] for Fonticons Inc. My Fonticons Inc., email address is [private]. Part of my duties include monitoring for DMCA violations. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have attempted to contact the owner, but they don't have an email posted and have issues disabled.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringed work is the Font Awesome Pro assets. This includes javascript, woff2, otf, svg, css, scss, and other files which we only make available to our pro clients.  
Much of the content is available here:  
[private]  
https://fontawesome.com  
You can also see our list of icons here: https://fontawesome.com/icons  
Here is our Pro license agreement which they have left in each folder indicating they are not authorized by us to give this away for free, etc.: https://fontawesome.com/license  
It looks like they have purchased our license and have downloaded our pro assets and are just re-hosting them as the naming and folder structure are identical. This is particularly problematic because they only thing they've contributed individually is a README that says to fork it (thus encouraging others to engage in copyright infringement.)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repo located at https://github.com/aolko/fontawesome-pro, except for the README, are our pro assets and being used in violation of our license.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There is one fork which is a copy and has all the same problems and should also be taken down: https://github.com/kothing/fontawesome-pro1

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I was unable to determine any contact information besides a [private] and [private] handle: [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
