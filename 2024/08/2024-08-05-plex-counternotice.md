Plex has sent takedown notices to three of my repositories. The other two are valid, but plex_loadfile_hook does not do any of what’s stated in the takedown notice: “sharing unauthorized product licensing keys, software for generating unauthorized product licensing keys, and/or software for bypassing checks for product licensing keys.”

It’s a mod that applies a fix for their incorrect use of an API, allowing users to use a more up-to-date version of the media player library. It is not a software crack and does not bypass any intentionally specified limitations.
