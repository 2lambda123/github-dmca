Dear DMCA Agent:

We are counsel for Wizards of the Coast LLC (“Wizards”), the owner of the copyrights and trademarks worldwide for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® (“D&D®”) roleplaying game and related merchandise, including books, manuals, magazines and other publications. Wizards’ copyrights include all editions of the D&D and ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS (“AD&D”) core rule books (the PLAYER’S HANDBOOK, MONSTER MANUAL, and DUNGEON MASTER’S GUIDE), supplemental rule books, campaign settings and other copyrighted online and printed publications. All of the artwork and details in these publications are the entirely fictional, creative, and copyrighted property of Wizards, including details on characters, classes, races, feats, spells, powers, items, rituals, and monsters, as well as all paragon and epic tier feats, paragon paths, and epic destinies. For reference, see https://dnd.wizards.com/ and https://www.dndbeyond.com/.
 
We write concerning two mirror sites at https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/ and https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/ that are backup for https://5etools.com/ and https://5e.tools/, identical sites (hosted elsewhere) that consist almost exclusively of content copied verbatim from Wizards’ D&D publications, including the core rulebooks, supplements, and campaign settings (see, for example https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/books.html and https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/books.html). In fact, contributors to the project are instructed that “[o]nly "official" (that is, published by WotC) data is to be included in the site.” See https://githuband .com/5etools-mirror-1/5etools-mirror-1.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

We have taken fair use into consideration.

We have a good faith belief that the content identified above infringes Wizards’ copyrights and other intellectual property rights and is not authorized by Wizards, its agents, or the law. We are authorized to act on Wizards’ behalf regarding these matters. The information provided in this communication is accurate to the best of my knowledge and is provided under penalty of perjury.
On behalf of Wizards, we therefore request that you act promptly to remove or disable access to https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/ and https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. This letter does not purport to be a complete statement of the facts or the law and is without prejudice to Wizards’ legal and equitable rights and remedies, all of which are expressly reserved.

Sincerely yours,

[private]
