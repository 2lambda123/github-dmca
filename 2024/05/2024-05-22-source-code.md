We have read and understand GitHub`s Guide to Filinf a DMCA Notice.  
Recently, the company I worked for contacted me and asked me to delete the code on github promptly. I had already deleted my code: [private] ([private]), but found that the code had been cloned because the other party [private] is on the github repository, and I tried to contact the author by submitting a push request, but I couldn't get a reply in time.  
The following is the github url of the cloned party, and the github repository with the name of my initial submission.
        
  [private]  

since：cckmit/mro-program  
github url: https://github.com/cckmit/mro-program  
This code contains some configuration information, which involves some core businesses of the former company. It is relatively sensitive. I need you to help me remove the cckmit/mro-program repository. I am very grateful!  
Below is my personal contact information： 
	
Company Name：[private]  
My e-mail Address：[private]  
Cellphone：[private]  
Company Address：[private]
