**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] and the [private] of the code, which I have published here https://github.com/wnelson03/RestoreCord-Source-Code

The same individual has repeatedly made frivolous DMCA notices to my copyright works, here's one example from 2022 https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/07/2022-07-14-restorecord.md

I request the individual/copyright claimaint's contact details such as name, phone number, address as I will need to elevate this to a legal dispute in a court of law.

The individual has even taken down the exact same repositories for the exact same false reason that was previously contested a year ago in 2022, such as https://github.com/GomCakes/RestoreCord-Source-Code.

The DMCA takedown is not legitimate and I look forward to seeing my copyighted work going back online on GitHub

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I request the individual/copyright claimaint's contact details such as name, phone number, address as I will need to elevate this to a legal dispute in a court of law.

The repeated false DMCA takedowns is a major problem. I have attempted to resolve this directly with the claimant. That has failed. The claimant is taking down each and every fork repository from my root repository https://github.com/wnelson03/RestoreCord-Source-Code. The reason the claimant is likely doing this is because it doesn't notify me, so the claimant likely believes they can sneakily get away with this violation of my copyright rights without me being directly notified by email, since it's every fork repository except my root repository.

I look forward to GitHub taking action on this abuse, as well as providing me the claimant's contact information so I can escalate this to a legal dispute in a court of law.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
