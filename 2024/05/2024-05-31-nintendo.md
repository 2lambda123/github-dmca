Before disabling any content in relation to this takedown notice, GitHub
- contacted the owners of some or all of the affected repositories to give them an opportunity to [make changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy#a-how-does-this-actually-work).
- provided information on how to [submit a DMCA Counter Notice](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice).

While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 127 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

[private] for the copyright owner, Nintendo of America Inc.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The copyrighted works are the Nintendo Switch firmware and Nintendo’s video games, such as those covered by U.S. Copyright Registration numbers PA0002213509 (Super Mario Maker 2); PA0002233840 (Animal Crossing: New Horizons); PA0002213908 (Luigi’s Mansion 3); and PA0002028142 (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild). More information about Nintendo’s copyrighted works can be found at the official Nintendo website at https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/.  
In addition to owning copyrights in its firmware and video games, Nintendo uses technological protection measures (“Technological Measures”), including those that permit the Nintendo Switch console to interact only with legitimate Nintendo video game files. This process protects Nintendo’s copyright-protected video games by preventing users from playing pirated copies of Nintendo’s video games on the Nintendo Switch console and by preventing users from unlawfully copying and playing Nintendo’s video games on unauthorized devices.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Nintendo embeds Technological Measures in both the Nintendo Switch console and video game files, including but not limited to encryption of the video game files which requires certain cryptographic keys, such as prod.keys, that are used to verify, access, and play each game played on the Nintendo Switch. The Technological Measures employ encryption as described in more detail below.  
The Nintendo Switch console allows users either to play games on physical cartridges that are inserted into the console, or to play games digitally downloaded from Nintendo’s server. Both formats are protected by Nintendo’s Technological Measures, including encryption of its video games. When games are started on the Nintendo Switch console, the games are decrypted and verified using various Nintendo cryptographic keys so they may be played. Nintendo owns or exclusively controls numerous copyrights in software and games that are protected from unlawful access and copying by the operation of these Technological Measures. In their ordinary course of operation, the Technological Measures require the application of information and a process (as described above), with the authority of Nintendo, to gain access to Nintendo’s copyrighted works, and thus effectively control access to and copying of Nintendo’s copyrighted works.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The reported repositories offer and provide access to unauthorized copies of cryptographic keys that are used to circumvent Nintendo’s Technological Measures and infringe Nintendo’s intellectual property rights. Specifically, the reported repositories provide to users unauthorized copies of cryptographic keys (prod.keys) extracted from the Nintendo Switch firmware. The prod.keys allow users to bypass Nintendo’s Technological Measures for digital games; specifically, prod.keys allow users to decrypt and play Nintendo Switch games in unauthorized ways. Distribution of keys without the copyright owner’s authorization is a violation of Section 1201 of the DMCA. [private]; [private]). Additionally, the unauthorized distribution of prod.keys facilitates copyright infringement by permitting users to play pirated versions of Nintendo’s copyright-protected game software on systems without the Nintendo Technological Measures or systems on which Nintendo’s Technological Measures have been disabled. Furthermore, the unauthorized distribution of prod.keys extracted from the Nintendo Switch firmware constitutes copyright infringement of Nintendo Switch firmware itself. These repositories also purport to provide access to unauthorized copies of the Nintendo Switch firmware and Nintendo’s video game files, all in violation of Nintendo’s copyrights. The repositories therefore violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the United States (specifically, trafficking in circumvention devices under 17 U.S.C. §1201), and infringe copyrights owned by Nintendo.  
The reported repositories attempt to evade detection of their illegal activities by providing access to prod.keys and unauthorized copies of Nintendo’s firmware and video games via encoded links that direct users to third-party websites to download the infringing content. The repositories provide strings of letters and numbers and then instruct users to “use [private] to decode the lines of strings given here to get an actual link.” The decoded links take users to sites where they can access the prod.keys and unauthorized copies of Nintendo’s copyright-protected material.  
  
**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes, we have searched for forks, which are listed above. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
No  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Reported content must be removed  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
No, we do not have contact information.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
