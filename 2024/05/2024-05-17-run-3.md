Run 3 is a 3D platformer game featuring ten characters and hundreds of levels. Its most recognizable game mechanic is the way the stage rotates when you touch a wall, allowing you to walk on that wall. It can be played at https://player03.com/run/3/beta/ .

Specifically, I assert that the level data and sprite sheet files are infringing. Because these are bundled into a larger single file, I request that that file be removed. However, I haven't found any other infringing material yet, so if they were to make their own levels and sprite sheets (using a different character design), I would have no reason to take that down.

Yes, and I linked to both repositories that I'm aware of.

No

Reported content must be removed
