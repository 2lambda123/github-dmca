**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our company employs various technological measures to control access to our copyrighted material. These measures include encryption protocols, access control mechanisms, and digital rights management (DRM) solutions. Encryption ensures that only authorized users with the appropriate decryption keys can access the copyrighted material. Access control mechanisms restrict access based on user authentication and authorization levels, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or modify the material. DRM solutions further enforce copyright protection by managing access rights, preventing unauthorized copying, distribution, or modification of the material.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project appears to be designed with the intent to circumvent our technological protection measures. Through reverse engineering or other means, the project aims to bypass encryption protocols, defeat access control mechanisms, or circumvent DRM solutions implemented to protect our copyrighted material. By doing so, the project enables unauthorized access, distribution, or modification of our copyrighted material, undermining the effectiveness of our technological measures in controlling access to the material.
