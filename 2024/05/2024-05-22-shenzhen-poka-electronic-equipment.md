The employee code of conduct and confidentiality agreement clearly stipulate that the project products developed for the company during the period of employment belong to the company and may not be used for other purposes or provided to third parties, let alone disclose company secrets. No project-related source code files can be leaked or released without the company's permission.

Without the company’s knowledge, employees secretly uploaded and saved source code products of related projects during their employment, which violated the company’s confidentiality system.

We have conducted a detailed review of the project code and its branches and confirmed that all source codes belong to the company’s project products and are actually run and used on the customer, which has brought huge security risks to the customer’s products.

The product source code does not obtain any open source license,

So, the best solution to suspected infringement is to delete it as soon as possible.

After investigation, no contact information of the alleged infringer was found.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I have taken fairuse into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guideto Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice. 

Thank you for your understanding and support, and we look forward to handling the removal matter as soon as possible.
