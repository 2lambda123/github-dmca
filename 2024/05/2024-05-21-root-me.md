**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
My name is [private] and I'm the the [private] of the foundation Root-Me.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
https://www.root-me.org/ : The foundation Root-Me is publishing/maintaining the portal root-me.org which is dedicated to information security learning through practical exercises. All those materials are under copyright, our legal information that users have to accept are available there :  
  
https://www.root-me.org/?page=structure&inc=page-mentions_legales&lang=en  
  
It is clearly forbidden (and penalized) to post exercise solution publicly. All those solutions use statement, code, URL, code of our exercises. We already propose to publish solution on our platform.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
As we do not consider publishing solution as a student work or a simple mention. We found out that the Github user 'EXP-Docs' have leaked Root-Me owned exercise:  
https://github.com/EXP-Docs/CTF-Solving-Reports/tree/master/rootme  
  
For example, you can find https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/Backup-file here: https://github.com/EXP-Docs/CTF-Solving-Reports/tree/master/rootme/Web-Server/[06]%20[10P]%20Backup%20file/README.md .  
Another example is https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/Hash-SHA-2 where the leak is available here https://github.com/EXP-Docs/CTF-Solving-Reports/tree/master/rootme/Cryptanalysis/[04]%20[5P]%20Hash%20-%20SHA-2/README.md .  
If you take a look at the directory, you will understand that the entire 'rootme' from the repository 'CTF-Solving-Reports' without exception contains Root-Me foundation properties that must be deleted or at least made private.
