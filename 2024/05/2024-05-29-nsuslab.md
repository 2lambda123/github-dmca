**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] from NSUSLAB. Our company previously managed a GitHub organization under the name "ncoin." However, after the administrator left the company, the management has been neglected, and we are currently unable to manage or control the "ncoin" organization.

We have requested access to this organization through our company administrator account from the GitHub support team, but our request was denied.

The content within the "ncoin" organization was created and managed by our company's employees, and the copyright belongs to our company. Therefore, we request the removal of this organization under the DMCA.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I'd like you to give [private] administrative authority to manage the https://github.com/ncoin organization, but if that's difficult, I'd like you to delete all the contents related to that organization.
