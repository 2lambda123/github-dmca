**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of an assetto corsa community that creates content including but not limited to: online servers, custom game assets, apps etc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

There has been a breach of content encryption (an encryption tool granted to me by [private] and [private] from the assetto corsa [private]) the 3d models in question we’re paid for entirely by me for usage on our servers and are released completely free to the public with the exception that the 3d models are fully encrypted to prevent unauthorized redistribution. There is a smaller community who has since been in contact with a developer who seems to only operate in bad faith and who i have proof in the past has tried to revert the security measures put in place on our content. In specific, 5 of our custom cars have been unencrypted and posted to a repository on github under the alias of another community owner whom they have since had a falling out with and have been trying to defame. All 5 of these cars have multiple hundreds of dollars and easily hundreds of hours of work behind them… and again are already released free of charge. Its a shame to have been dragged into this as we’ve always loved our community and looked to operate within good faith. Im filling this out out of respect for my car developer and friend who has easily spent 10,000 hours perfecting his craft and trying to satisfy our supporters.

Here is the link to the repository that includes our unencrypted content: https://github.com/YukioWLW/TGA-Cars-Unenc-SWERVIN-ON-TOP

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Basically the entire repository aside from the “read me” document.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Both [private] .KN5 Encryption Tool for the actual encryption of the 3d modelled assets… this also includes a data.acd encryption to prevent any of the asset’s coding to be altered. The data encryption is needed to prevent Compu’s ACI Entitlement Script from being removed or altered.

[private] ACI Entitlement Tool is to prevent the content being redistributed or utilized on servers that do not have the corresponding script server side. This tool is only granted to those in the community who acknowledge that all content must be of aquired and distributed legally.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

They have bypassed the .kn5 encryption and negated the need for the ACI Entitlement as they have posted the 3d models themselves, allowing other developers to utilize the 3d models that we paid for and assembled in the 3d space.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I believe this is the only repository but i wouldnt be surprised if they create another account to simply post them again.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

The only contact info i have for the alleged infringer is his [private] unfortunately. His [private] is: [private]. As for the people already utilizing and redistributing our content in correlation with [private]. (His team of developers and partners in his community) their [private] are:
