**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] for Fonticons Inc. My Fonticons Inc., email address is [private]. Part of my duties include [private]. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I opened an issue to the offending user several days ago asking them to take down the site, but they have not responded.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringed work is the Font Awesome Pro assets. This includes javascript, woff2, otf, svg, css, scss, and other files which we only make available to our pro clients.
Much of the content is available here:  
[private]  
https://fontawesome.com  
You can also see our list of icons here: https://fontawesome.com/icons  
Here is our Pro license agreement which they have copied verbatim though they are not authorized by us to give this away for free, etc.: https://fontawesome.com/license  
This is particularly egregious because the user placed their own MIT copyright on the front page but I can see no work that is theirs.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/eliyantosarage/font-awesome-pro

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
