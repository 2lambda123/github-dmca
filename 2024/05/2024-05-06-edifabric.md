**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of EdiFabric https://www.edifabric.com, a software company offering developer libraries for EDI files. The older versions of our product were distributed to licensed customers as two unlocked DLL files. At the time, copying these files elsewhere and using them illegally was possible. I have now noticed that a version of these files is in a repository on GitHub.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work has never been posted online. It was only available for purchase by legitimate customers from the company's website - https://www.edifabric.com/pricing.html. Some old versions were provided to customers unlocked and without protection, so it was possible to use them unlicensed. This has now been rectified for some time; however, older versions of the product are still vulnerable. We submitted several takedown notices in the past with GitHub for the same files, and all were successfully resolved.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files in this folder:  
https://github.com/Tamour-Nobility/TestRepo/tree/main/Additional%20Testing%20Code/API_Libraries
