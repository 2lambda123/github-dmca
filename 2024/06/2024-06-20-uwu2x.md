**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the copyrighted work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is the source code and architecture of software [private], named "uwu2x." This software is an extension and a script for After Effects that improves the quality and smoothness of clips. The software consists of an After Effects script (a JSX file) and multiple Python files that are executed by the JSX file to upscale and interpolate clips directly within After Effects.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

As part of the uwu2x copyright protection strategy, [private] employed various technological measures to control access to [private] intellectual property. These measures include :  
- code obfuscation : the code is not human-readable and cannot be reverse-engineered without altering its functionality ;  
- license-based access control : [private] implemented a license management system to govern access and usage of [private] software based on specified terms and conditions outlined in [private] licenses. This allows precise control over who can access [private] software and under what conditions ;  
- watermarking : [private] utilize watermarking to uniquely identify [private] intellectual property.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project appears to have been specifically designed to circumvent [private] technological protection measures in the following ways :  
- deobfuscation techniques : the accused project employs sophisticated methods to deobfuscate [private] obfuscated code, thereby attempting to unravel the protective layer [private] implemented to safeguard [private] intellectual property ;  
- license violation : the accused projet makes [private] software available (by download) without the licensing system ;  
- removed [private] wattermark and licenses ;

Additionally, [private] deobfuscated code was previously published on this repository : [invalid] (owned by the same person who stole [private] copyrighted work), and it was taken down following a previous DMCA takedown notice ([invalid]). This demonstrates that the infringer's "code" was created and is entirely based on [private] software and source code. This is evident from the architecture : the interface is very similar, exhaustively incorporating all the functionalities of [private] software. The infringing code also includes the JSX script and uses Python files, and its scripts communicate through a function and software architecture that [private] entirely created.
