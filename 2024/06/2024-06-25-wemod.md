**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
  
No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
  
GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
Copyright belongs to WeMod LLC, a [private] company, which I am authorized to act on behalf of as [private].  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
Our desktop software, WeMod, allows gamers to easily modify their single-player PC games. Certain features of the app are only available to our paid "Pro" subscribers. The repository in question is actively circumventing measures we have in place to keep those features paywalled.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
https://github.com/DaBaival/wemod-pro-unlocker  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Our desktop app will only enable Pro-only features if our server returns to it proof that the user has an active paid subscription. Without this response from the server, the app blocks Pro features from being used.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The project in question patches WeMod's local installation files to 1) disable file integrity checks, and 2) spoof the network response that would otherwise say the user does not have an active subscription. This allows a user of this project to access (nearly) all of WeMod's paid-only features for free. This includes, but is not limited to, interactive controls, our overlay, and an ad-free experience.  
  
**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
