Hi, I am the [private] of a Blender Add-on known as 'MecaFace' which is being sold officially on the MecaBricks Store.
When a user buys it, it has a license that says they CANNOT distribute the files to anyone no matter what.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The product allows the user to have a panel inside of blender which can add a 2d face rig to the selected object.  
Here is where [private] currently sell it: https://www.mecabricks.com/en/shop/product/6
