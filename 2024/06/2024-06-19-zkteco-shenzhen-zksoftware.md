During [private] at ZKTeco Shenzhen ZKSoftware Co., Ltd., I mistakenly uploaded the code to GitHub. This code is considered as the company's internal asset and should be kept confidential. The company has notified me via email that the code has been uploaded to GitHub and disseminated, which is suspected of illegal infringement, and it needs to be completely removed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

1. The original repository's URL that was uploaded to GitHub should be: [private]. This repository was deleted several years ago. However, other repositories forked from it have not been deleted.  
2. The source code in this repository is for access control software and belongs to ZKTeco Shenzhen ZKSoftware Co., Ltd.  
3. In the forked repository, the first commit uploaded to GitHub by the [private] account can be seen at: https://github.com/ma7dy/C3-jzl/commit/9c01e61e134faeaffc07e01e9b05fddac786eb4b

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
