**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

They have taken [private] code, obfuscated it to hide evidence that it is [private]. I'm sure you can see history though so it isn't a worry to me. They also tried adding an MIT license (Yes, it was made before i published [private], but their lua file was published after [private]).

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, there is no forks on the repository. They release the code on their Discord to be used.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

They did not add credits to the code, and proceeded to obfuscate to try and get away with it.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Adding credits to the code, or making repo private

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
