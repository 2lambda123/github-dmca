For a few weeks in [private], the Github user "epitt92" worked for us as a freelancing consultant, and signed an NDA and a contract that we own all rights to the code. After "epitt92" had finished his work for us, he decided to upload our private code to a public repository located at https://github.com/epitt92/skogshubben. We initially reached out to "epitt92" asking him to take it down, which he did [private]. The repository was hidden for a long time, but has now again been made public on his account, sparking the need for this DMCA takedown.
