Hello, after internal review by our clients BGI Gene and Qunar, it was found that the configuration information and methods exposed in these two warehouses were correct and were code written internally by the company, but were exposed.  
For example, in the first repository, lines 16-23 of the file disclose the account password and URL of the database.  
In the second warehouse, lines 22-26 also disclose the account password and URL of the database. There are also methods for creating, deleting, and modifying orders in other files in the warehouse.
