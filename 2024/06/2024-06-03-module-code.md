Three years ago we contracted a team in [private] to develop a module in [private] company's project, named [private]. We keep it confidential as a project, on [private] we keep it as a private [private], also hosted in [private] and the way they had access to our codebase is via credentials we gave them on [private]. After 3 years we get an email from google saying that our google API private key publicly accessible in github, mentioning also the url to that key! That's how we stumbled upon this public repo of that module! We don't know how it ended up here, we have no contact with the company in [private] anymore, and I'm sure they will not take any responsibility anyways. They got paid for the developments and the contract ended, both parts happy! Its not a litigation what we want. What we want is just for this repo to be shut down!

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] (it is private, always has been!). If any sort of information is required in order to proof the infringement we can provide it, privately, but not with a public url, we hope you understand that's not possible! We have the full git history codebase of this repo, with its creation dating before the date on this repo! [private] not only authorized to act in the name of [private] company, [private] actually the guy who created this repo himself, from scratch!

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

No

There are no other forks. It's just this repo!

No

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do have contacts of the company that we think it was leaked from. But We don't have actual proof its them. For as much as we can tell, a github user posted this code 3 years ago. (user's url: https://github.com/Namankhulbey)
