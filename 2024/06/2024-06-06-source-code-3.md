I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the [private] and [private] of the code, the code is part of a bigger project and is only the frontend part but it is a one for one copy of [private] work.
The code in the cloned repository is a flagrant and shameless copy/paste of [private] original work and is in direct contradiction to the license [private] set for that code. Moreover the user who created the repository is actively advertising it for commercial purposes.

Additionally requested information by GithubSupport:

As advised i'm replying to the claims insinuating that the original work is licensed under the open-source license, this is not true though, the original work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License and is an open-access license but by no means it is open-source.
You can find the license at https://github.com/Zer0-bit/gaggiuino?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme
The repositories i'm submitting a DMCA request about are not in compliance because they are engaged into private commercialization of the code as part of a private [private] group as well as you can find proof of this by going to the store link engaged in the said commercialisation https://www.matter-replicator.com/product/4-3-inch-display-upgrade/

This is all against the license and the user has not wanted to comply wiht [private] polite requests to obey it.
Moreover the projects don't even mention the code is a blatant copy of [private] original work, you can even find a fork of [private] original code repository in the user's account [private]
