Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

1. As stated above, all these games are arcade games and therefore, those are available only for those who purchased our games.
2. Alleged game may be classified in 2 types. The first was stolen from the arcade game. The second group was stolen from the online platform for distributing arcade games.(Platform name: "NESiCA Live" and "NESiCA Live2")
3. Access to the game is limited to those who purchased to above two services. We have learned that above games were stolen from those services(method unknown) and were distributed unlawfully.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This is just a speculation, however, emulator or something similar was used to extract the data from Electric Circuit Board for games which is, obviously, not approved by TAITO.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This has not been searched.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we do not have their contact iformation.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
