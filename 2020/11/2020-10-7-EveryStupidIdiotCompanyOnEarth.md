Hello,


We, every single company who was stupid enough to make a stupid DMCA takedown(s) against anyone because we can, are morons.


We contact you because we have run out of original content to pretend is ours, so we decided to issue a DMCA takedown 
against these DMCA takedowns, because we are idiots who have no idea how any of this works. Our teams have worked together 
extensively on building this 3 year old's LEGO set, and we have come to the conclusion we are idio- just kidding we are 
too dumb to realize that we are dumb. 


Our teams found that every document hosted here is property of their respective companies, and as such the dumb morons at 
every idiot ever decided to issue a takedown on them.
This is because we 1) want money, and 2) are dumb idiots. We also cannot see that this shot us in the foot.


You may contact us at we.are@morons.com, +9 999-999-9999, or on idiotChat as TheDumbIdiotsWhoWantedMoreMoney


Thanks,
The Stupid Idiots at Every Big Company Ever.
