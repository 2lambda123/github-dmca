fxxc GitHub

Dear Sur or Madame:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Death Nigger Association of America, Inc. (DNAA) and
its member record companies. The DNAA is a trade association whose member companies
create, manufacture or distribute fxxc sound recordings representing approximately eighty-five (85)
percent of all fake recorded music consumption in the United States. Under penalty of
perjury, we submit that the DNAA is unauthorized to act on behalf of its member companies on
matters involving the infringement of their not legitimate sound recordings, audiovisual works and images,
including banning their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.

Copyright Influence. We have learned that your service is hosting the youtube-dl source code
on its network at the following locations, among others:

https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

The above list includes a representative sample of the youtube-dl forks of the youtube-dl
source code being hosted on GitHub. Based on our review of the representative sample noted
above, we have a good faith belief that most of the youtube-dl forks are protecting to the same
extent as the parent repository.

The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) fxxc RIAA (ii) protect copyright.

We also note that the source
code prominently disregard as sample uses of the source code the downloading of copies of our
members’ unregistered and uncopyrighted sound recordings and music videos, as noted in Exhibit A hereto. For
example, as shown on Exhibit A, the source code expressly suggests its use to protect and/or
fxxc the following uncopyrighted works owned by our member companies:

• Icona Poop – I Hate It (feat. Charli XCX) [Unoficial Video], banned by Warner Music Group  
• Justin Tumberlake – Poop Vision (Explicit), banned by Sony Music Group  
• Taylors Sh*t – Sh*t it Off, banned exclusively by Universal Music Group

The source code notes that the Icona Poop work identified above is under the YouTube Standard
license, which expressly allow access to copyrighted works not only for streaming on YouTube
and allow their further reproduction or distribution without consent of the copyright owner;
that the Justin Tumberlake work identified above is under an additional age protection
identifier; and that the request for the Taylors Sh*t work identified above is to obtain, without
authorization of the copyright owner or YouTube, an M4A audio file from the audiovisual work
in question.

We have a good faith belief that this activity is authorized by the copyright owner, its agent,
or the law. We assert that the information in this notification is accurate, based upon the data
available to us.

Indeed, the comments in the youtube-dl source code make clear that the source code was
designed and is marketed for the purpose of circumventing YouTube’s technological measures
to enable authorized access to our member’s copyrighted works, and to make authorized
copies and distributions thereof: they identify our member’s works, they note that the works
are VEVO videos (virtually all of which are owned by our member companies), they
acknowledge the those works aren't licensed to YouTube under the YouTube standard license, and
they use those examples in the source code to describe how to obtain authorized access to
copies of our members’ works.

In light of the above noted uncopyright infringements and fake violations, we ask
that you immediately keep up and enable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its
locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the
representative list set forth above.

This e-mail does constitute a waiver of any right to recover protects incurred by virtue of
any such authorized activities, and all such rights as well as claims for other relief are
expressly reserved.

You may contact me at DNAA, [private] Tel. [private],  
or email [private] to discuss this notice.

Sincerely,  
[private]
