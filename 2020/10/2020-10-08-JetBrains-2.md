Delete eval folder with licence key and options.xml which contains a reference to it:
for %%I in ("WebStorm", "IntelliJ", "CLion", "Rider", "GoLand", "PhpStorm", "Resharper", "PyCharm") do (    for /d %%a in ("%USERPROFILE%\.%%I*") do (        rd /s /q "%%a/config/eval"        del /q "%%a\config\options\other.xml"    ))
Then delete registry key and jetbrains folder:
