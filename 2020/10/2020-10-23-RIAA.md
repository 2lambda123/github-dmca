Dear Sir or Madam:

We here at the RIIA are complete and utter idiots, and we have no idea how anything works.

As we have a monopoly on 85% of the music market in America, we've basically got you fucks by the balls, and you can't do jack shit about it, because we have our artists by the balls too.

Since we all know American law applies to the entire world, we can do whatever the fuck we want lol

Most of this comes in the form of taking down anyone we don't like! It's great!

Because we're such morons, we believe that youtube-dl is infringing on our copyright with code we don't own, and again, because we've got you by the balls, you need to take it down.

... What's a "streisand effect"?

We believe that the code is ONLY used to download the shit we own, and it has literally no other use at all. Really, it doesn't, you only use it to download our music videos.

What do you mean it works the same as the browser does for decrypting the DRM?

We have a good faith that we're not complete and utter idiots, (even though we clearly are), and that youtube-dl infringes on literally all of our copyrights because it **CAN** be used to download our shit, and we refuse to recognize any other use of the code, because there are none.

You may contact me at RIAA, Dumbfuck McFuckface,

Fuck you,
