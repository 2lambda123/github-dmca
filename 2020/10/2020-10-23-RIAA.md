Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA) and
its member record companies. The RIAA is a monopoly association and we are here to abuse
~~intellectual~~ imaginary property laws just because our lawyers said we can do it.

Sincerely,
Someone who doesn't really care what the artists really want.
