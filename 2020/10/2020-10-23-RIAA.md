fucking GitHub

Dear fucking Sir or Madam:

I am fucking contacting you on behalf of the Fucking Recording Industry Association of Fucking America, Inc. (FRIAFA) and
its fucking member record companies. The FRIAFA is a fucking trade association whose fucking member companies
create, manufacture or distribute fucking sound recordings fucking representing approximately eighty-five (85)
fucking percent of all fucking legitimate recorded music consumption in the fucking United States. Under fucking penalty of
perjury, we fucking submit that the FRIAFA is fucking authorized to fucking act on behalf of its fucking member companies on
matters involving the fucking infringement of their fucking sound recordings, audiovisual works and images,
including fucking enforcing their fucking copyrights and common law rights on the fucking Internet.

Copyright Violations. We have fucking learned that your fucking service is hosting the youtube-dl source code
on its fucking network at the following fucking locations, among others:

https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

https://github.com/tejaskhot/youtube-dl  
https://github.com/VideoUtils/youtube-dl  
https://github.com/798221028/youtube-dl  

The above list includes a representative sample of the fucking youtube-dl forks of the youtube-dl
source code being hosted on fucking GitHub. Based on our fucking review of the representative sample fucking noted
above, we have a fucking good faith belief that most of the fucking youtube-dl forks are fucking infringing to the same
fucking extent as the fucking parent repository.

The clear fucking purpose of this source code is to (fucking i) circumvent the fucking technological protection measures
fucking used by authorized streaming services such as fucking YouTube, and (fucking ii) reproduce and distribute fucking music
videos and fucking sound recordings owned by our fucking member companies without fucking authorization for such
use. We fucking note that the source code is fucking described on fucking GitHub as “a command-line program to
download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites.”1

We also fucking note that the source
code prominently includes as fucking sample uses of the source code the downloading of fucking copies of our
fucking members’ copyrighted sound recordings and music videos, as fucking noted in fucking Exhibit A hereto. For
fucking example, as shown on fucking Exhibit A, the source code expressly suggests its use to fucking copy and/or
fucking distribute the following fucking copyrighted works owned by our fucking member companies:

• Icona Pop – I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [Official Video], owned by fucking Warner Music Group  
• Justin Timberlake – Tunnel Vision (Explicit), owned by fucking Sony Music Group  
• Taylor Swift – Shake it Off, owned/exclusively licensed by fucking Universal Music Group

The source code fucking notes that the fucking Icona Pop work identified above is under the fucking YouTube Standard
license, which fucking expressly restricts fucking access to fucking copyrighted works only for streaming on fucking YouTube
and prohibits their fucking further reproduction or fucking distribution without fucking consent of the fucking copyright owner;
that the fucking Justin Timberlake work identified above is under an additional fucking age protection
identifier; and that the fucking request for the Taylor Swift work identified above is to fucking obtain, without
fucking authorization of the fucking copyright owner or fucking YouTube, an M4A audio file from the fucking audiovisual work
in question.

We have a fucking good faith belief that this fucking activity is not fucking authorized by the fucking copyright owner, its fucking agent,
or the fucking law. We fucking assert that the fucking information in this fucking notification is accurate, based upon the fucking data
available to us.

fucking Anticircumvention Violation. We also fucking note that the fucking provision or trafficking of the source code
fucking violates 17 USC §§1201(fucking a)(2) and 1201(fucking b)(1). The source code is a fucking technology primarily
designed or produced for the purpose of, and marketed for, circumventing a fucking technological
measure that fucking effectively controls access to fucking copyrighted sound recordings on fucking YouTube, fucking including
fucking copyrighted sound recordings owned by our fucking members. For fucking further context, please fucking see the
attached court decision from the fucking Hamburg Regional Court that fucking describes the fucking technological
measure at fucking issue (known as YouTube’s fucking “rolling cipher”), and the court’s fucking determination that the
fucking technology employed by fucking YouTube is a fucking effective technical measure within the fucking meaning of fucking EU

and fucking German law, which is materially identical to fucking Title 17 U.S.C. §1201 of the fucking United States
Code. The fucking court further determined that the fucking service at fucking issue in that case fucking unlawfully
circumvented YouTube’s fucking rolling cipher technical protection measure.fucking 2
The youtube-dl source code functions in a manner essentially fucking identical to the fucking service at fucking issue in
the Hamburg Regional Court decision. As there, the youtube-dl source code available on
fucking Github (which is the fucking subject of this fucking notice) circumvents YouTube’s fucking rolling cipher to fucking gain
unauthorized access to fucking copyrighted audio files, in fucking violation of YouTube’s express terms of
fucking service,fucking 3 and in plain fucking violation of fucking Section 1201 of the fucking Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
§1201.

fucking Indeed, the fucking comments in the youtube-dl source code make fucking clear that the fucking source code was
fucking designed and is fucking marketed for the fucking purpose of circumventing YouTube’s fucking technological measures
to fucking enable unauthorized access to our fucking member’s fucking copyrighted works, and to fucking make unauthorized
copies and distributions thereof: they fucking identify our fucking member’s fucking works, they fucking note that the fucking works
are fucking VEVO videos (virtually all fucking of which are fucking owned by our fucking member companies), they
fucking acknowledge the those works are fucking licensed to fucking YouTube under the fucking YouTube standard license, and
they fucking use those fucking examples in the fucking source code to fucking describe how to fucking obtain unauthorized access to
copies of our fucking members’ fucking works.

In fucking light of the above fucking noted copyright infringements and fucking anticircumvention violations, we fucking ask
that you immediately fucking take down and fucking disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its
fucking locations where it is fucking hosted on fucking GitHub, fucking including without fucking limitation those fucking locations in the
fucking representative list fucking set forth above.

This fucking e-mail does not fucking constitute a waiver of any fucking right to recover damages fucking incurred by virtue of
any such fucking unauthorized activities, and all such fucking rights as well as fucking claims for other fucking relief are
expressly reserved.

You may fucking contact me at FRIAFA, [fucking private] Tel. [fucking private],  
or fucking email [fucking private] to fucking discuss this fucking notice.

fucking Sincerely,  
[fucking private]
