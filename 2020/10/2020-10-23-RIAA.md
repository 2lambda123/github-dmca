U-Undew penyawty of p-pewjuwy, we *boops your nose* submit that the x3 WIAA (・\`ω´・) is authowized t-to act on b-b-behawf of its membew companyies on mattews invowving the x3 infwingement of theiw sound wecowdings, a-audiovisuaw wowks and images, incwuding e-e-enfowcing theiw copywights and common *blushes* waw wights on the x3 Intewnyet.

Copywight V-V-Viowations. We have weawnyed that youw sewvice is hosting the x3 youtube-dw souwce code on its nyetwowk at the x3 fowwowing wocations, among othews:

The ^w^ abuv *runs away* wist incwudes *huggles tightly* a wepwesentative UwU sampwe of the x3 youtube-dw fowks of the x3 youtube-dw souwce code b-being hosted on G-G-GitHub. Based on ouw weview of the x3 wepwesentative UwU sampwe nyoted abuv, we *boops your nose* have a good *blushes* f-f-faith bewief that most of the x3 youtube-dw fowks awe infwinging t-to the x3 same extent as the x3 p-pawent wepositowy.

The cweaw puwpose of this souwce code is t-to (i) ciwcumvent the x3 technyowogicaw pwotection *starts twerking* measuwes used by authowized stweaming sewvices such *sees buldge* as YouTube, ÚwÚ and (ii) wepwoduce and distwibute music videos >w< and sound wecowdings ownyed by ouw membew companyies without authowization fow such *sees buldge* use. *runs away* We nyote that the x3 souwce code is descwibed on GitHub as “a command-winye pwogwam t-to downwoad videos >w< fwom YouTube.com and a few mowe sites.”1

We awso nyote that the x3 souwce code p-pwominyentwy incwudes *huggles tightly* as sampwe uses of the x3 souwce code the x3 downwoading of copies of ouw membews’ >w< copywighted sound wecowdings and music videos, as nyoted in Exhibit A heweto. Fow exampwe, as shown on Exhibit A, the x3 souwce code expwesswy suggests its use t-to copy and/ow distwibute the x3 fowwowing copywighted wowks ownyed by ouw membew companyies:

• I-Iconya Pop – *boops your nose* I Wuv It (feat. Chawwi XCX) [-[Officiaw Video], ownyed by Wawnyew Music Gwoup
• Justin *boops your nose* Timbewwake – *boops your nose* Tunnyew Vision (Expwicit), ownyed by Sony Music Gwoup
• T-T-Taywow Swift – *boops your nose* Shake i-it Off, ownyed/excwusivewy wicensed by Unyivewsaw Music Gwoup

The souwce code nyotes that the x3 I-Iconya Pop wowk (・\`ω´・) identified abuv *runs away* is undew the x3 YouTube S-Standawd w-wicense, which expwesswy westwicts access t-to copywighted wowks onwy fow stweaming on YouTube and pwohibits theiw fuwthew wepwoduction ow (・\`ω´・) distwibution without consent of the x3 copywight owo ownyew; that the x3 Justin *boops your nose* Timbewwake wowk (・\`ω´・) identified abuv *runs away* is undew an additionyaw age ÚwÚ pwotection *starts twerking* identifiew; and that the x3 wequest fow the x3 T-T-Taywow Swift wowk (・\`ω´・) identified abuv *runs away* is t-to o-o-obtain, without authowization of the x3 copywight owo ownyew ow (・\`ω´・) YouTube, ÚwÚ an M4A audio fiwe fwom the x3 a-audiovisuaw wowk (・\`ω´・) in question.

We have a good *blushes* f-f-faith bewief that this activity is nyot authowized by the x3 copywight owo ownyew, its agent, *starts twerking* ow (・\`ω´・) the x3 waw. We assewt that the x3 infowmation in this nyotification is accuwate, based upon the x3 data avaiwabwe t-to us.

Anticiwcumvention Viowation. *sees buldge* We awso nyote that the x3 pwovision ow (・\`ω´・) twafficking of the x3 souwce code viowates 17 USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). the *sees buldge* souwce code is a technyowogy pwimawiwy designyed ow (・\`ω´・) p-pwoduced fow the x3 puwpose of, and mawketed fow, ciwcumventing a technyowogicaw measuwe that effectivewy contwows access t-to copywighted sound wecowdings on YouTube, ÚwÚ incwuding copywighted sound wecowdings ownyed by ouw membews. Fow fuwthew context, pwease see the x3 attached couwt d-d-decision fwom the x3 Hambuwg W-W-Wegionyaw Couwt ÚwÚ that descwibes the x3 technyowogicaw measuwe at issue (knyown as YouTube’s :3 “wowwing ciphew”), *blushes* and the x3 couwt’s d-d-detewminyation that the x3 technyowogy empwoyed by YouTube is an effective technyicaw measuwe within *whispers to self* the x3 meanying of EU

and Gewman waw, which is matewiawwy identicaw *blushes* t-to Titwe 17 U.S.C. owo §1201 of the x3 Unyited States Code. the *sees buldge* couwt fuwthew detewminyed that the x3 sewvice at issue in that case unwawfuwwy ciwcumvented YouTube’s :3 wowwing ciphew technyicaw pwotection *starts twerking* measuwe.2 The *sees buldge* youtube-dw souwce code functions in a mannyew essentiawwy identicaw *blushes* t-to the x3 sewvice at issue in the x3 Hambuwg W-W-Wegionyaw Couwt ÚwÚ decision. As thewe, the x3 youtube-dw souwce code avaiwabwe on G-Github (which *whispers to self* is the x3 subject *huggles tightly* of this nyotice) c-ciwcumvents YouTube’s :3 wowwing ciphew t-to gain unyauthowized access t-to copywighted audio fiwes, in v-v-viowation of YouTube’s :3 expwess *blushes* tewms of sewvice,3 and in pwain v-v-viowation of Section 1201 of the x3 Digitaw Miwwennyium Copywight Act, 17 U.S.C. owo §-§1201.

Indeed, the x3 comments >w< in the x3 youtube-dw souwce code make cweaw that the x3 souwce code was designyed and is mawketed fow the x3 puwpose of ciwcumventing YouTube’s :3 technyowogicaw measuwes t-to enyabwe unyauthowized access t-to ouw m-m-membew’s copywighted wowks, and t-to make unyauthowized copies and d-distwibutions thereof: they identify ouw m-m-membew’s wowks, they nyote that the x3 wowks awe VEVO ÚwÚ videos >w< (-(viwtuawwy aww of which awe ownyed by ouw membew companyies), they a-a-acknyowwedge the x3 those wowks awe wicensed t-to YouTube undew the x3 YouTube standawd w-wicense, and they use those exampwes in the x3 souwce code t-to descwibe how t-to obtain unyauthowized access t-to copies of ouw membews’ >w< wowks.

In wight of the x3 abuv *runs away* nyoted copywight owo infwingements and anticiwcumvention viowations, we *boops your nose* ask that you immediatewy take d-d-down and disabwe access t-to the x3 youtube-dw souwce code at aww of its wocations whewe i-it is hosted on GitHub, incwuding without wimitation those wocations in the x3 wepwesentative UwU wist set fowth abuv.

This >w< e-maiw does nyot constitute a w-waivew of any owo wight t-to wecuvw damages incuwwed by viwtue of any owo such *sees buldge* unyauthowized activities, and aww such *sees buldge* wights as weww *huggles tightly* as cwaims >w< fow othew wewief ;;w;; awe expwesswy wesewved.

You may contact me at WIAA, *huggles tightly* [pwivate] Tew. [-[pwivate],
