Deaw Siw ow Madam:

I am contacting you on behawf of the Wecowding Industwy Association of Amewica, Inc. (WIAA) and
its membew wecowd companyies. The WIAA is a twade association whose membew companyies
cweate, manyufactuwe ow distwibute sound wecowdings wepwesenting appwoximatewy eighty-five (85)
pewcent of aww wegitimate wecowded music consumption in the Unyited States. Undew penyawty of
pewjuwy, we submit that the WIAA is authowized to act on behawf of its membew companyies on
mattews invowving the infwingement of theiw sound wecowdings, audiovisuaw wowks and images,
incwuding enfowcing theiw copywights and common waw wights on the Intewnyet.

Copywight Viowations. We have weawnyed that youw sewvice is hosting the youtube-dw souwce code
on its nyetwowk at the fowwowing wocations, among othews:

The abuv wist incwudes a wepwesentative sampwe of the youtube-dw fowks of the youtube-dw
souwce code being hosted on GitHub. Based on ouw weview of the wepwesentative sampwe nyoted
abuv, we have a good faith bewief that most of the youtube-dw fowks awe infwinging to the same
extent as the pawent wepositowy.

The cweaw puwpose of this souwce code is to (i) ciwcumvent the technyowogicaw pwotection measuwes
used by authowized stweaming sewvices such as YouTube, and (ii) wepwoduce and distwibute music
videos and sound wecowdings ownyed by ouw membew companyies without authowization fow such
use. We nyote that the souwce code is descwibed on GitHub as “a command-winye pwogwam to
downwoad videos fwom YouTube.com and a few mowe sites.”1

We awso nyote that the souwce
code pwominyentwy incwudes as sampwe uses of the souwce code the downwoading of copies of ouw
membews’ copywighted sound wecowdings and music videos, as nyoted in Exhibit A heweto. Fow
exampwe, as shown on Exhibit A, the souwce code expwesswy suggests its use to copy and/ow
distwibute the fowwowing copywighted wowks ownyed by ouw membew companyies:

• Iconya Pop – I Wuv It (feat. Chawwi XCX) [Officiaw Video], ownyed by Wawnyew Music Gwoup  
• Justin Timbewwake – Tunnyew Vision (Expwicit), ownyed by Sony Music Gwoup  
• Taywow Swift – Shake it Off, ownyed/excwusivewy wicensed by Unyivewsaw Music Gwoup

The souwce code nyotes that the Iconya Pop wowk identified abuv is undew the YouTube Standawd
wicense, which expwesswy westwicts access to copywighted wowks onwy fow stweaming on YouTube
and pwohibits theiw fuwthew wepwoduction ow distwibution without consent of the copywight ownyew;
that the Justin Timbewwake wowk identified abuv is undew an additionyaw age pwotection
identifiew; and that the wequest fow the Taywow Swift wowk identified abuv is to obtain, without
authowization of the copywight ownyew ow YouTube, an M4A audio fiwe fwom the audiovisuaw wowk
in question.

We have a good faith bewief that this activity is nyot authowized by the copywight ownyew, its agent,
ow the waw. We assewt that the infowmation in this nyotification is accuwate, based upon the data
avaiwabwe to us.

Anticiwcumvention Viowation. We awso nyote that the pwovision ow twafficking of the souwce code
viowates 17 USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). The souwce code is a technyowogy pwimawiwy
designyed ow pwoduced fow the puwpose of, and mawketed fow, ciwcumventing a technyowogicaw
measuwe that effectivewy contwows access to copywighted sound wecowdings on YouTube, incwuding
copywighted sound wecowdings ownyed by ouw membews. Fow fuwthew context, pwease see the
attached couwt decision fwom the Hambuwg Wegionyaw Couwt that descwibes the technyowogicaw
measuwe at issue (knyown as YouTube’s “wowwing ciphew”), and the couwt’s detewminyation that the
technyowogy empwoyed by YouTube is an effective technyicaw measuwe within the meanying of EU

and Gewman waw, which is matewiawwy identicaw to Titwe 17 U.S.C. §1201 of the Unyited States
Code. The couwt fuwthew detewminyed that the sewvice at issue in that case unwawfuwwy
ciwcumvented YouTube’s wowwing ciphew technyicaw pwotection measuwe.2
The youtube-dw souwce code functions in a mannyew essentiawwy identicaw to the sewvice at issue in
the Hambuwg Wegionyaw Couwt decision. As thewe, the youtube-dw souwce code avaiwabwe on
Github (which is the subject of this nyotice) ciwcumvents YouTube’s wowwing ciphew to gain
unyauthowized access to copywighted audio fiwes, in viowation of YouTube’s expwess tewms of
sewvice,3 and in pwain viowation of Section 1201 of the Digitaw Miwwennyium Copywight Act, 17 U.S.C.
§1201.

Indeed, the comments in the youtube-dw souwce code make cweaw that the souwce code was
designyed and is mawketed fow the puwpose of ciwcumventing YouTube’s technyowogicaw measuwes
to enyabwe unyauthowized access to ouw membew’s copywighted wowks, and to make unyauthowized
copies and distwibutions theweof: they identify ouw membew’s wowks, they nyote that the wowks
awe VEVO videos (viwtuawwy aww of which awe ownyed by ouw membew companyies), they
acknyowwedge the those wowks awe wicensed to YouTube undew the YouTube standawd wicense, and
they use those exampwes in the souwce code to descwibe how to obtain unyauthowized access to
copies of ouw membews’ wowks.

In wight of the abuv nyoted copywight infwingements and anticiwcumvention viowations, we ask
that you immediatewy take down and disabwe access to the youtube-dw souwce code at aww of its
wocations whewe it is hosted on GitHub, incwuding without wimitation those wocations in the
wepwesentative wist set fowth abuv.

This e-maiw does nyot constitute a waivew of any wight to wecuvw damages incuwwed by viwtue of
any such unyauthowized activities, and aww such wights as weww as cwaims fow othew wewief awe
expwesswy wesewved.

You may contact me at WIAA, [pwivate] Tew. [pwivate],  
ow emaiw [pwivate] to discuss this nyotice.

Sincewewy,
