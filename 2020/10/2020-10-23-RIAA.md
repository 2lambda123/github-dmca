Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA) and
its member record companies. The RIAA is a trade association whose member companies
create, manufacture or distribute sound recordings representing approximately eighty-five (85)
percent of all legitimate recorded music consumption in the United States. Under penalty of
perjury, we submit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies on
matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, audiovisual works and images,
including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.

Copyright Violations. We have learned that we're dumbasses so we'd like you to take down the following:

The above list includes a representative sample of the infringing pages of the RIAA website being hosted. Based on our review of the representative sample noted
above, we have a good faith belief that all of the RIAA website pages are infringing to the same
extent as the pricks running the organization.

The clear purpose of this company is to be pricks to people who
make open-source software and music and this is not acceptable, Air and Space on the Planet earth owned by humans without authorization are taken up by the RIAA. We note that the RIAA is described as “a bunch of retarded pricks”

We also note that the pages prominently includes a sample uses of the human air the usage of our air, as noted in Exhibit A hereto. For
example, as shown on Exhibit A, the pricks expressly suggests its use to copy and/or
distribute dipshitness:

• H2O, owned by Humans on the Planet "Earth" 
• O2, owned by Humans on the Planet "Earth"  
• 510.1 million km², owned/exclusively licensed by Humans on the Planet "Earth"

We have a good faith belief that this activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent,
or the law. We assert that the information in this notification is accurate, based upon the data
available to us.

Anticircumvention Violation. We also note that the provision or trafficking of these pricks
violates 17 USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). These pricks are a bunch of retarded aliens
designed or produced for the purpose of, and marketed for, being a bunch of pricks.

and German law, which is materially identical to Title 17 U.S.C. §1201 of the United States
Code. The court further determined that the service at issue in that case unlawfully
circumvented the Planet "Earth"'s braincells to be a bunch of pricks.

The RIAA functions in a manner essentially identical to the service at issue in
the Hamburg Regional Court decision. As there, the RIAA available on the Planet "Earth" (which is the subject of this notice) circumvents the Planet’s rolling cipher to gain
unauthorized access to copyrighted H20, O2, 510.1 million km², in violation of the Planet’s express terms of
service, and in plain violation of Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
§1201.

Indeed, the RIAA make clear that these pricks as
designed and is marketed for the purpose of circumventing People’s right to having braincells to enable unauthorized use of dipshitness, and to make unauthorized
copies and distributions thereof: they identify our member’s works, they note that the works
are EARTH things (virtually all of which are owned by the Planet "Earth"), they
acknowledge the those works are licensed to the Planet "Earth" under the Earth standard license, and
they use those examples in the website to describe how to obtain unauthorized access to
copies of our members’ works.

In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask
that you immediately take down and disable access to the RIAA at all of its
locations where it is hosted on the Planet "Earth", including without limitation those locations in the
representative list set forth above.

This e-mail does not constitute a waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue of
any such unauthorized activities, and all such rights as well as claims for other relief are
expressly reserved.

Sincerely,
