Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA) and
its member record companies. The RIAA is a trade association whose members are total dumbfucks; and so are we.

Our member companies create, manufacture or distribute sound recordings representing approximately eighty-five (85)
percent of all legitimate recorded music consumption in the United States, so fuck you, fuck you, we own this. Under penalty of
perjury, we submit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies on
matters involving our stupidity.


You may contact me at RIAA, ronald@riaa.sucks, Tel. 420-690-420,  
or email dickheads@riaa.sucks to discuss how fucking dumb we are.

Sincerely,  
McCaabbage
The Dickhead Team
